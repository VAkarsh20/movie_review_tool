Title,Rating,Comments,Review Date,Id
Pathaan,6.5,"Overall, a pretty decent watch that has a lot of fun elements and lighter moments (like some of the jokes and the dance sequences), but follows the generic Bollywood Action movie formula so much that the movie is very predictable and bland (with the non-linear storytelling not helping as well)",02/27/2023,321
Self Reliance,7.3,"Overall, a fun watch that blends comedy and thriller elements very well as the movie is a pretty funny and captivating directorial debut from for Jake Johnson, though it very predictable in its plot and pretty safe overall as it falls too much into the 2010s comedy tropes",03/19/2023,324
"You Sing Loud, I Sing Louder",5.4,"Overall, a movie that suffers from having too low of a budget as the performances by the leads cannot save this artsy/indie film as it is held back by poor acting from the rest of the cast, bland writing (though not all of it is bad), and poorly executed sequences (whether it be scenes with a lot of dead air or the climax itself)",03/19/2023,325
BlackBerry,8.8,"Overall, an extremely entertaining movie that blends multiple genres to create an engaging biopic that tell the story of a famous company where not that much is known about them, with all the cinematic elements of the film coming together to drive the story forward",03/19/2023,326
Tetris,8.2,"Overall, a very entertaining movie that is a well constructed fun watch to see how Tetris escaped the Soviet Union as the tone coupled with performances help bring the audience on a fun ride, though the movie is a bit too safe in its writing and storytelling",03/19/2023,327
Evil Dead Rise,4.9,"Overall, a movie that has very well executed horror sequences, but overall feels like it panders more into the splatter genre than actually making a movie as it cares too much about being gory and providing scary moments than having a well structured horror plot because of how bad the writing and plot construction is (with the biggest issue being how the conflict is handled throughout the movie)",03/19/2023,328
Joy Ride,5.8,"Overall, a movie that was a decent watch as it follows the standard Seth Rogen/2010s comedy template to bring East Asian female representation to the comedic world, but is ultimately not really made for me as the film is a hit or miss on jokes given I have kinda outgrown the raunchy comedy style and a lot of the jokes were geared towards East Asians (so I could see how the East Asian female demographic would really enjoy this movie)",03/19/2023,329
Theater Camp,9.0,"Overall, an extremely funny movie that is well made as this mockumentary looks into the eyes of a typical theater camp through the use of improv, hand-held cinematography, and funny writing to make this movie very captivating and a great watch overall (my favorite film of SXSW)",03/19/2023,330
Creed III,6.8,"Overall, a decent to pretty good watch in this part of the Rocky/Creed franchise as we get to see some unique features in new storytelling and fighting scenes, but the movie does have its issues as it is way shorter than it should've been given the plot really does not build the rising action at all and there is no real tribute/allusions to Rocky himself (which makes it hard for me to really compare this movie to others in the franchise given my bias towards the original movies)",03/21/2023,331
Air,8.1,"Overall, a very fun watch about the story of how Michael Jordan signed with Nike as the all-star cast really propels the story forward to make this movie very enjoyable, though it really does not go above and beyond in any way as it is a pretty straightforward biopic with cliche writing (which is kinda the point as it felt like this movie wasn't taking itself too seriously as it was just a couple of friends having fun on a project)",04/01/2023,332
The Super Mario Bros Movie,6.2,"Overall, a decent children's movie that does a good job in staying very true to the games and is carried by its voice cast, but is limited by it being mostly a children's movie (with only nostalgia keeping adults interested) and a very short runtime as the hero's journey really cannot develop (along with the relationship between Mario and Peach)",04/10/2023,333
Renfield,5.5,"Overall, a movie with memorable performances from Hoult and Cage and well executed action sequences, but has incredibly corny writing and is very formulaic and predictable",04/17/2023,334
John Wick: Chapter 4,8.2,"Overall, the best movie of the franchise by far as its use of cinematography, technical elements, and fight choreography make this movie such a fun watch and a benchmark in how to make action movies going forward due to the grand nature of this chapter, but the movie feels very long with its unnecessary cramming of plot and slow pace",04/20/2023,337
Beau is Afraid,4.4,"Overall, a chaotic mess from a talented director as he fails to direct this poorly constructed horror film as he tries way to hard to be edgy and grotesque rather than actually be a good storyteller with a compelling script, so much to the point that the cinematography/sound/editing and performance by Phoenix cannot save this 3 hour mess from being watchable as it feels more like a waste of time then a compelling watch",04/24/2023,338
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,8.0,"Overall, a good end to the trilogy that has become a staple in the MCU as James Gunn uses tone/writing/visual effects to build off his previous comedic movies while also creating what might be the saddest/most touching Marvel movie (mainly through the backstory/writing of Rocket), but the movie does fall under the trap many Marvel movies follow as it is a bit too restricted by the predictable MCU boilerplate to be more profound that it is capable of being",05/07/2023,342
Fool's Paradise,1.9,"Overall, a complete miss from one of my favorite comedic actors of the 21st century as he creates a very shallow movie with no substance as the script and direction really do not play into his strengths at all, making the movie not funny or profound in any way (making you wonder how this project even got green light)",05/12/2023,343
"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.",6.3,"Overall, a decent coming of age story as it follows the typical boilerplate to tell the story, though it does not really go above and beyond in any way and I was really not a fan of the ending/message",05/16/2023,344
The Machine,6.2,"Overall, a surprisingly fun watch as the audience gets to see how the famous Machine story gets interweaved into a action-comedy movie, though it does have its cliche moments that make the movie a bit shallow",05/25/2023,346
The Flash,6.5,"Overall, a decent superhero movie as the more micro elements of the movie coupled with the playful tone made the film a fun watch and engaging overall (especially the dual role of Ezra Miller and Michael Keaton returning as Batman), but the overuse of CGI and the pretty predictable plot makes this movie a bit too late in the race to the Multiverse",06/01/2023,347
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,9.5,"Overall, another groundbreaking film in the franchise that only builds on everything they created in the previous film as the brilliant animation and incredible writing is used to show the audience a well-rounded story about a Spider-Man who is trying to find his place in the world, with the only major drawback of the movie being that it suffers from the flaws of it being one of two parts",06/03/2023,349
Past Lives,8.7,"Overall, a movie that uses subtly, writing, and direction very well to show a profound story between two lovers from distant worlds, but can only go so far given its long exposition and short runtime",06/10/2023,350
Asteroid City,5.1,"Overall, a very Wes Anderson movie that misses the mark as his typical confusing storytelling and bland dialogue/acting outweighs his strengths in cinematography and produciton design as the movie just feels very boring and not memorable",06/28/2023,351
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,6.8,"Overall, a pretty lackluster sendoff for one of the best characters/franchises in cinema history as many moments are entertaining to see (like the action sequences and Harrison Ford being Indiana Jones), but the lack of chemistry between the two leads and the very bad ending do not do Indiana Jones justice in what is his final ride",06/28/2023,353
No Hard Feelings,6.0,"Overall, a decent watch overall as the chemistry between the two leads make this movie a funny and entertaining watch, though the audience does have to get through a poorly executed exposition and tropes/cliches from movies of the makeover and Rom-Com genre",06/29/2023,354
Mission: Impossible â€“ Dead Reckoning Part One,8.0,"Overall, a very entertaining watch that is fueled by good acting and great action scenes as Tom Cruise delivers another action-packed Mission Impossible movie, though it is a bit story dense given its runtime and it being one of two parts",07/06/2023,356
Cocaine Bear,3.3,"Overall, a movie that has no redeeming qualities at all as it is poorly written, not funny, and not that well directed as the only thing that is memorable about this movie, in the end, is the title",07/24/2023,357
Oppenheimer,9.6,"Overall, a modern masterpiece that transcends the biopic as Nolan delivers a masterclass in direction, writing, and acting (with Cillian Murphy delivering a career-defining performance) as the movie is breathtaking from top to bottom with how it uses many different elements to help share its true message about the horrors of one's creation (and the implication it may have on the future)",07/24/2023,358
Barbie,8.1,"Overall, a feminist powerhouse of a movie as Greta Gerwig exceeded my expectations to create a very fun movie to watch as it is filled with an enjoyable cast, funny jokes, and memorable production design, costumes, and soundtrack as the movie tells many different messages about self-image and societal power, even though it is very on-the-nose about it and does not tie up all the loose ends",07/24/2023,359
Sound of Freedom,2.9,"Overall, an important topic that does not hit the mark as the movie is incredibly over-the-top with its bad direction, acting, and writing as it embellishes the truth to try to bring to light the subject matter (which only hurts its credibility)",07/25/2023,361
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,5.0,"Overall, a miss in my eyes as the animation style does not make up for its poor execution and writing (with its corny use of modern references and poor plot construction making it too short to leave any profound effect), though children/fans of the TMNT franchise may like this movie more than me",07/31/2023,362
Shortcomings,5.0,"Overall, a pretty bland movie that tries way too hard to be meta and 'anti-woke' that it does not do a good job at being realistic as the direction of actors is pretty bad and the writing is bland/predictable, with the ending feeling like a Dhar Mann video",08/07/2023,364
The Creator,6.7,"Overall, a movie that has many technical achievements but plays way too much into its trope as the original characters do not hide it from following a very similar structure to movies like Avatar, and the medicore direction and acting doesn't do a good job in helping move past this flaw either",09/29/2023,369
Dumb Money,7.6,"Overall, an entertaining movie about the Wall Street Bets situation as the movie stays true to being a comedy-drama as it uses comedic actors and a lot of internet humor to help tell a somewhat serious situation, but because of this it feels like the movie is very cringy at times; also, it just feels like the movie was made too soon as it like just happened (which ruins a lot of the learning aspect of a biopic)",10/04/2023,370
Saw X,6.3,"Overall, a surprisingly decent Saw movie as it does a good job in being more narrative focused as the story and acting of Tobin Bell helps the audience sympathize with his struggle, and the traps and horror writing was the best it has been since the original Saw movie (though it does spend a bit too much time in the exposition and does have a lot of the same flaws that other Saw movies have)",10/06/2023,371
The Exorcist: Believer,3.4,"Overall, a complete disservice to the original movie as the very bad direction, overt/unnatural writing, and cheap horror tactics are the exact opposite of what the original was going for as nothing can save this mess from being watchable",10/08/2023,372
Killers of the Flower Moon,8.6,"Overall, a very good movie that is driven by the experience and chemistry of Scorcese, DiCaprio, and Di Nero as the director uses his signature charm to tell a captivating story about a dark time in American history, but its unnecessarily long runtime really brings the movie down from being something truly great",10/20/2023,374
Saltburn,7.6,"Overall, a bold attempt at a grand movie in Emerald Fennell's sophomore effort as she really builds the grand world of Saltburn through cinematography and production design and gets a lot out of her actors (especially Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi), but, in the end, is held back by having too many continuity issues/loose ends and going overboard with the more grotesque scenes",10/27/2023,375
American Fiction,8.6,"Overall, a very good effort in Cord Jefferson's directorial debut as Jeffery Wright's performance and very good comedy writing/direction propel the movie into something very funny yet profound with its social commentary",10/27/2023,376
The Holdovers,8.7,"Overall, a profound coming-of-age dramedy that really embodies the time period it is set as the performances (especially Paul Giamatti's) coupled with the writing really shows the impact loneliness has on people at different point's of their lives, although the movie is held back by playing too much into the time-period as it can only do so much with following the 70s Christmas trope",10/28/2023,377
Finestkind,2.3,"Overall, a complete misfiring on all cylinders as everything in this movie is so bad that is borderline camp on New England culture, making it a must watch to see how something this terrible got made into a movie",10/29/2023,378
The Promised Land,8.7,"Overall, a very polished period drama that is executed well on many fronts as the direction, cinematography, and performances from Mads Mikkelsen and Amanda Collin help create a very captivating movie, but the writing and story construction hold it back from being something great",10/29/2023,379
All of Us Strangers,7.7,"Overall, a well-written movie that is carried out by its good performances (especially Andrew Scott's) as the blurred perception of reality creates a unique movie about dealing with trauma and identity, though it is very slow and a victim of its own convoluted storytelling at times",10/30/2023,380
The Bikeriders,7.9,"Overall, a pretty good movie into the life of the golden era of midwest biker gangs as the performances (especially Jodie Comer's) and the technicals make this an engaging and interesting movie, though the slice of life nature drags it down the first half and rushes the overall conflict",11/01/2023,382
The Trap,6.0,"Overall, a decent directorial debut from Lena Headey as she uses the movie as an outlet to show the effects loneliness has on people, though it does suffer from having a very slow pace and its low budget limiting how engaging it can be",11/01/2023,383
Day of the Fight,5.6,"Overall, a movie that has a somewhat interesting premise led by the performance of Michael Pitt and good cinematography as it is pretty evident where it drew inspiration from movies like Raging Bull, Rocky, and The Wrestler to tell the story of a fighter-down-on his luck, but its lack of chemistry in the cast and writing flaws hold it back from being something memorable",11/05/2023,384
The Marvels,3.8,"Overall, a complete mess as the movie does not hit on any angles and there are obvious points where the studio interfered with the cut, bringing into question what the direction of Marvel is going forward",11/13/2023,385
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,4.7,"Overall, a poorly executed movie as the direction and writing fail to build Snow up to be a bad guy to the point that they have to force this by the time the movie ends (making the first two acts of the movie feel pointless), but the movie is entertaining in the second act because they convey The Hunger Games well",12/01/2023,386
Napoleon,4.5,"Overall, a complete misfire from such a legendary director as the bad direction, very bad writing, and laughable performance from Joquan Phoneix make this movie such a fun watch from how bad it is, as it seems that that Ridley Scott has officially lost the plot",12/06/2023,388
Godzilla Minus One,9.0,"Overall, a great film that is executed well on a both technical and literary level as the well choreorgraphed action sequnces are coupled with surprisingly deep, symbolic writing as the movie tackles complex issues like survivor's guilt, trauma, and what it means to be alive, making this movie a must watch",12/11/2023,389
The Boy and the Heron,7.2,"Overall, a very beautiful movie with its animation and score as it feels more like an art piece than an actual story, which is telling given how poorly constructed the plot is with its slice of life first half and plot-heavy/rushed second half",12/11/2023,390
Wonka,5.6,"Overall, a pretty generic, formulaic musical comedy that does not execute well on either front as the writing is very predictable and the musical performances are very bland, with Chalamet's performance feeling more like a Jim Carrey imitation than a young Willy Wonka",12/14/2023,391
The Iron Claw,7.9,"Overall, a captivating story that is told through very good writing and great editing as the audience witnesses the rise and fall of the Von Erich family, but it is held back from being a must-watch by its stiff direction and lack of chemistry within the cast (though the singular performances of Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, and Holt McCallany did make the movie entertaining)",12/14/2023,392
May December,7.6,"Overall, a movie that is carried by its performances and interesting story as Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore, and Charles Melton act as powerful storytellers for such an uncomfortable, traumatic scandal, though the movie just feels a bit too amateur with its forced artistic vision (imitating The Room at times) and leaves with so many questions that are left unanswered",12/17/2023,395
Anyone But You,4.4,"Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny",12/20/2023,396
Poor Things,9.0,"Overall, a well-executed, unique take on the coming-of-age dramedy as the direction, writing, and acting (especially Emma Stone's performance) all come together to show the impact society has on an individual as Bella is a blank canvas painted by the people she interacts with, though the movie does drag at points and could have been cut to make it tighter",12/22/2023,397
Maestro,6.2,"Overall, a disappointing sophomore effort by Bradley Cooper as his performance cannot save his movie as it falters from a lack of focus on what it wants to portray as you do not really learn anything about Leonard Bernstein or his relationship with Felicia Montealegre",12/24/2023,398
Ferrari,6.4,"Overall, a decent watch with a simple story into a troubling period in Ferrari's history that has a very memorable performance from Penelope Cruz, but is held back by its choppy direction, editing, and technicals",12/28/2023,400
The Killer,4.5,"Overall, a very boring movie that is not executed well as it feels like an amatuer director was doing his best David Fincher impression making this",01/04/2024,402
The Color Purple,7.5,"Overall, a pretty good musical filled with memorable performances by the whole cast, but is hurt by its storytelling and writing",01/06/2024,403
