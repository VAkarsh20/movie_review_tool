Juno -1 
Pretty Good Direction (Did a fine job in moving the story forward, and the cut of the movie was fine, but nothing was really spectacle with the acting between the cast or showing the symbolism), Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good to Good from Elliot Page (Showed Good moments, but for the most part played the pretentious teenager who is filled with angst and overly blurts 00s slang), Pretty Good from Michael Cera (just played the Michael Cera character), Decent to Pretty Good from Jennifer Garner, Decent to Pretty Good from Jason Bateman, Decent to Pretty Good from Allison Janney, Pretty Good from J. K. Simmons, Decent from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (the generic coming of age story about an angsty girl, with the backdrop of the teenage pregnancy), Decent Screenplay (some of the jokes were decently funny, but there was an exaggeration of how teens talked in the 00s (especially with them cramming in way too much of the slang; also, the angsty parts were annoying to watch)), Pretty Good Score and Soundtrack, Decent Cinematography, Plot Structure was clear and clean as segment of the story was effectively shown, Pacing was good as the short runtime was effectively used to convey everything that was needed to be said (there was no need to add more time), The build to the climax was pretty good with the actual climax really showing the true nature of all the characters. Overall, a decent to pretty good movie that was a generic coming-of-age story that was masked with the backdrop of the teenage pregnancy and annoying, angsty moments.
Spider-Man: No Way Home -40 
Great Direction (Especially the ability to capture the sad, humor, and action moments, and the ability to have all the characters work with each other despite being from different times), Very Good to Great Acting (Very Good to Great from Tom Holland (was able to capture more of the darker, depressing side of Peter Parker while still capturing his boyish side), Very Good from Benedict Cumberbatch, Great from Willem Dafoe (Left right off where Spider-Man (2002) ended as he was able to switch between both personalities effortlessly), Very Good from Alfred Molina (same with Dafoe, was able to take up where he left off with Spider-Man 2), Very Good from Marisa Tomei, Great from Andrew Garfield (The best performance of the movie as he was able to be 360 in showing the emotions of a fractured, failed Spiderman), Very Good from Tobey Maguire (Started off a bit rusty given that Maguire has not had a live action role in 7 years, but after getting his grove back, he was able to show why he was the best Spiderman), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (While a very simple plot, the ability to mix and mold the different timelines and storylines together into one is great to see; though there are a bit of some plot holes given the spells), Great Screenplay (The ability to capture humor while also being serious was very entertaining; also, the easter-eggs in dialogue from the previous franchises were also great to see), Good to Very Good Score, Great to Incredible Cinematography, Great Sound, Great to Incredible Visual Effects (though it did look a bit cartoony), Great Costumes (especially at how they were able to accent/get previous costumes from the older franchises), Plot Structure was great as the movie was broken down effectively into parts that build on each other, Pacing was very good as it uses all its scenes effectively (even though the runtime is a bit longer), Build to the climax is great with the climax being the best part of the movie (it shows the maturity and growth of all the three spidermans), Incredible Casting (something I rarely comment on, but the ability to get all the previous Spider-Man actors who were not under contract (as well as the ability to keep the spoilers under wraps) is something that deserves applause in itself); the fan service of the movie is a prime example of how it should be done (it accents all the previous franchises while still showing the brilliance of the current one); the main message/theme of the movie is about second chances (seen with Peter Parker explaining this with the reason to hold the fight at the Statue of Liberty) as all three Spidermans get a second-chance at something that was taken from them (Tobey Maguire's Spiderman gets his second chance at saving Norman Osborn while also getting closure on his career defining role, Andrew Garfield gets his second chance at saving MJ (something he could not do with Gwen) while also redeeming himself from the failures of his franchise to show how capable of a Spiderman he really was, Tom Holland's Spiderman gives his second chance away to his best friend and girlfriend as he sacrifices his life so that they can succeed without him); it is important to also note how amazing of a cinematic experience this was as I have never seen a crowd so invested in the movie as they cheered and got on their feet for different moments (like when the different Spidermen and daredevil were introduced, and when Andrew Garfield gets his second chance) and I really believe this will be the movie to bring theaters back from the pandemic. Overall, a defining comic-book movie that is filled with action, humor, and sadness as we get to see some familiar faces get second chances and get the closure they never got with both their characters and their careers.
Home Alone 0 
Very Good to Great Direction (able to bring out the humor and joy in many moments, helps set the lighthearted tone that Kevin brings throughout the movie), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Great from Macaulay Culkin (able to bring the charm the movie is known for), Great from Joe Pesci (able to bring the charm the movie is known for), Very Good from Daniel Stern (the good comedic relief to the comedic relief from Joe Pesci), Good to Very Good from Catherine O'Hara, Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Great to Incredible Story (Something that was very unique and iconic for the time as it takes the Christmas movie genre to new heights), Very Good to Great Screenplay (Filled with iconic lines but the actual dialogue is pretty simple (mostly due to the movie staring a child and it being a family movie)), Incredible Score (One of John Williams most iconic works), Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Plot Structure was very nicely laid out as there are no real wasted scenes in developing the story, Pacing was great as it was a steady pace that used its runtime very nicely, Build to the climax was great as it helped tie loose ends in Kevin's fears of being alone and with the old man; climax is the most iconic part of the movie as it shows Kevin against the Wet Bandits as he lays the house out with traps to defend himself and show how he is not afraid anymore. Overall, one of the best christmas movies ever made as we get to see the iconic elements carried out by Culkin and the wet bandits as they navigate through the different traps and high jinks, and I would rate this movie higher but I personally prefer the sequel more due to personal reasons.
West Side Story 123 
Incredible Direction (especially as he is able to transition through the serious moments and musical numbers, while simultaneously getting the most out of his cast; also, uses the cinematography and editing very well to drive the story forward), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Ansel Elgort (Able to hold his own throughout the movie and shows a surprisingly good singing voice), Decent to Pretty Good from Ariana DeBose (Her acting was on the better side but I was not so much of a fan of her over-the-top, exaggerated singing as I felt it took too much out of the songs), Good to Very Good from David Alvarez, Good to Very Good from Mike Faist, Good to Very Good from Rita Moreno, Great to Incredible from Rachel Zegler (Able to show so much range in her feature debut as she navigates through the different parts of the film effortlessly and shows a powerful singing voice through all the numbers), Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (Mostly takes from the original Broadway production and films (but still a great retelling of Romeo and Juliet filled with Puerto Rican and American influences), really helped show the audience why it is still a classic), Great to Incredible Screenplay (Filled with great dialogue that mixes both English and Spanish and is very true to the times it portrays (have not watched the original productions to say whether or not it is similar)), Incredible Score (just a rendition of the original scores); Very Good to Great Musical Numbers (Musical renditions were either better, the same, or worse in this compared to the previous renditions; Choreography was incredible and needed to be highlighted though), Incredible Cinematography (especially with the way it uses light and different colors to make scenes more lively in such dark, torn-down areas), Great Sound (makes it feel as if it was mixed and edited back in 1960), Great Editing, Incredible Production Design (the clash between the color and dark elements really make the movie show the beauty in the poverty the characters live in), Incredible Costumes (Similar to what the Production Design gives to the movie), Plot Structure was mostly identical to the original movie (though it is still good in terms of how everything is laid out, I would have liked to have seen more in terms of moments between Maria and Tony), Pacing was good overall as it did not really feel rushed or dragging at points, Build to the climax is well done as we get to see tensions building from the rumble between the Sharks and the Jets and how the aftermath effects the characters; climax itself is a pivotal part in the movie as we get to see Tony and Maria's true love come out (though logically it needs to be pointed out how unrealistic the events actually would be). Overall, a great remake of the original as we get to hear and see new faces, and old, carry out iconic characters and numbers as this new rendition pays homage to the original in may ways while also holding its own as it brings back the flair and numbers that make West Side Story one of the most well-known musicals of all time.
It's a Wonderful Life 17 
Very Good Direction, Good to Very Good Acting (Incredible from James Stewart (especially his ability to go through different emotions throughout the movie and take command of every scene), Good to Very Good from Donna Reed (A good companion performance to Stewart's), Good to Very Good from Lionel Barrymore, Good to Very Good from Henry Travers, Good from the rest of the cast), Good to Very Good Story (While the concepts, elements, and the 'retelling' of 'A Christmas Carol' was very good/iconic, the movie spends too much of the story on the exposition to where the more memorable parts are barely a part of the movie), Very Good Screenplay (helps propel some of the more intense, emotional scenes), Pretty Good Score, Great Cinematography, Great Sound, Decent to Pretty Good Editing (especially for the time, though there were some noticeable editing jumps from poor cutting), Incredible Visual Effects (especially for the time, with the animation and the snow), Plot Structure was not good (the first hour and 20 minutes is all exposition to set up the life of George Bailey, the conflict is really only presented with only 30-40 minutes left in the movie; the Christmas element of the movie is only really presented towards the last 30-40 minutes of the movie), Pacing is not great as the first 3/4 of the movie is pretty slow while the last 1/4 the pace is pretty quick to make up for the fact at how much exposition there is, Build to the climax ramps up the pace of the movie as the movie shifts to the part it is known for; climax is great as we get to see what George Bailey is truly missing with contemplating his life, The themes of suicide were pretty taboo at the time so it was great to see a movie like this tackle it in the 1940s; the actual christmas elements of the movie only show up in the final 40-45 minutes (so while it technically is a Christmas movie, Christmas is more of a part of this movie rather than a key element (at least for the first 3/4)). Overall, a good watch that stands the test of time as we get to see George Bailey find out the true importance of life and how valuable it really is in this Christmas classic, even though it falters in its plot structure taking away from its best elements.
Wedding Crashers 47 
Pretty Good Direction, Pretty Good Acting (Good from Owen Wilson (While there was nothing spectacular about their performances, the chemistry the two leads have is incredible to where it helps propel the story and the jokes forward), Good from Vince Vaughn (See Owen Wilson), Pretty Good to Good from Christopher Walken, Pretty Good to Good from Bradley Cooper, Great from Will Ferrell (even though it is a cameo and it is a bit over-the-top, his scene is one of the most memorable ones of the movie cause of how much command he has and how funny it is), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Decent Story (the story is incredibly predictable and cliche as it is one of the prime examples of 00s Rom-Coms), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (pretty simple in the dialogue/symbolism, but the jokes are pretty funny throughout the movie and keep you interested), Pretty Good to Good Score, Pretty Good Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Plot Structure was fine for the most part (but I think it should spend a bit more time in the 10 minutes before the climax because the audience is just kinda thrown into Vaughn and Fisher's characters getting married (cause no passage of time is really given, just that they are 'moving quickly')), Build to the climax was decent (while it does have the best moment of the movie (Chazz scene), it really does not go that well into the fallout between Wilson and Vaughn's characters and the latter's relationship (maybe like 10 minutes cut from the middle to put into that would have helped)); the climax is pretty cliche but not bad overall (its a 00s rom-com after all). Overall, a fun movie to watch that is filled with many memorable quotes and good laughs, but what holds the movie back is it reeking of the 00s Rom-Com archetype with its predictable story and constant cliches, so it would probably be a fun movie to watch in the background or picking it up in the middle on TV.
CODA -35 
Great Direction (especially the ability to control the scenes with deaf actors (especially during the signing arguments)), Great Acting (Very Good to Great from Emilia Jones (Able to hold her own and was great in the more emotionally intense scenes (played the angsty character very well as well)), Great to Incredible from Troy Kotsur (Stole the show with his comedic, humorous moments and was the real emotional rock for the family as his actions play a vital role in Jones's character finding herself), Great from Marlee Matlin (plays her role very well and shows a lot of range), Very Good from the rest of the cast), Good to Very Good Story (The story is very predictable because of it being a bildungsroman movie but there are some unique elements that make it interesting to watch (like the juxtaposition of being a singer in a deaf family)), Very Good Screenplay (especially the usage of ASL in intense arguments, though the imagery/symbolism is a bit surface-level (mostly due to it being a coming of age story)), Decent Score, Good Cinematography, Very Good Sound (especially with the lack of to mimic how the deaf characters are witnessing the scene), Good Editing, Plot Structure good (kinda just follows the generic bilsdungroman plot structure so there really are not issues), Pacing is good (would not really add or cut any scenes as the movie uses its runtime effectively), Build to the climax is evident and present (kinda predictable though); climax is a great performance and a culmination of all the hopes and dreams of the characters (though it was kinda predictable what would happen); resolution is touching as it shows how much the family cares for Ruby and how much she cares for them, The major issues of the movie is how much this movie plays to the bilsdungroman archetype as it is incredibly predictable and very surface-level in its meanings of growing up and managing conflicts. Overall, a good movie that is carried by the strong performances of the entire cast as we get to see a rare insight into deaf culture, though the movie is held back by it playing way too much to the coming-of-age genre through its cliches and predictable plot.
Tick, Tick... Boom! 5 
Good Direction (The flow and driving the movie forward was very good, the numbers were carried out well; issues are with interpersonal scenes because there is always a large mismatch between Garfield and his co-stars (especially in the more emotional, argumentative scenes)), Acting is on a spectrum (Incredible performance by Andrew Garfield (Really transforms himself into the character as his mannerisms are to a T, he carries every scene he is in as he really shows his range, his singing actually is pretty good as well for someone who has never had a musical background), Decent by Alexandra Shipp (handles scenes decently well but really falters in the augmenting/emotional scenes as you can see the limit she is trying to pass), Pretty Good to Good from Robin de Jesús (overall, he commands himself very well and acts as a great side to Garfield, singing is also a plus in his performance, but he really hits his limit and falters in the emotional augmenting scenes), Pretty Good from Vanessa Hudgens (actually no complaints from her performance, just nothing special considering her character is meant more for the musical numbers), Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (either Bad or Pretty Good)), Very Good to Great Story (very inspiration and details the trials and tribulations Larson when through as he was struggling as an writer; however, it is a major cop out to say that 'the story was true, except when it was not' as just say its true or exaggerated), Good to Very Good Screenplay (the screenplay was pretty simple in terms of its dialogue (also extremely meta, like I understand thats what he was going for its just I hate meta things), but there is great use of foreshadowing and symbolism as it alludes to what inspires Larson to write Rent), Score/Numbers were hit or miss (I liked some of the songs and did not like others), Pretty Good Cinematography (kinda falters when it shows the numbers as it feels limited by the poor effects), Good Sound, Great Editing (especially the cuts between shots when doing the numbers), Very Bad Visual Effects (the overlays of notes and effects were not that bad, its just that it is very obvious when they are using a green-screen as it is not poorly put into the scene), Pretty Bad Production Design (the overall sets were fine, its just they used CGI to complete some of the sets (in the numbers especially)), Plot Structure was good, Pacing is good for the most part (think it gets a bit too fast towards the end), Build to the climax is anti-climatic (but this a good thing) as it shows the constant cycle of Larson getting his hopes up then failing; the resolution feeling empty is a bit symbolic as it shows how Larson was striving for success his entire life (and even though he did achieve it, he never saw it with his own eyes), the journey of Jonathan Larson is very touching as we get to see him almost on the verge of giving up but continuing to push through adversity (and as I said, even though he never gets to see it; he gets to have his legacy live on). Overall, a movie carried by Andrew Garfield as he transforms himself into Jonathan Larson as he tells the story of building a legacy and to keep on going (even if you never get to see your success), though it held back by some of its numbers, limited acting/direction, and very bad CGI.
Don't Look Up 2 
Good Direction, Very Good Acting (Great from Leonardo Dicaprio (though it is not one of his better performances), Very Good from Jennifer Lawrence (played her character very well, her performance was just limited by what the script allowed her to do), Good to Very Good from Rob Morgan, Great from Jonah Hill (playing a character he built his name off of early in his career (which is great to see)), Very Good from Mark Rylance (especially with the awkwardness of the tech character), Very Good from Cate Blanchett, Good to Very Good from Meryl Streep, Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (Though it is a mess in terms of how the plot is structured (a given from McKay nowadays)), Pretty Good Screenplay (the jokes were actually pretty funny and back to his old self as his script really was not taking itself too seriously as it was in McKay's previous two movies (standout joke being the non-sequiturs to the General asking for money for the snacks; it is pretty obvious at how the movie tries to force politics into its message, its just extremely overt and not well carried out cause of how overt it is)), Pretty Good Score, Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Plot Structure was a bit of the mess (there are really two climaxes (and while the movie does a good job heading into the first one, it becomes a huge mess after the this as it goes to the end)), No consistent pace at all in the movie (some parts felt slow and some parts felt really fast), Build to the climax (or two climaxes) is done well as the real climax is more built off of the suspense coming down with the characters' having their realizations, The forced political message of the movie really makes it a mess as the inconsistent structure and very simple showing of this message really hurts at what the movie is trying to show. Overall, it is great to see Adam McKay play more to his roots at not taking himself too seriously as he creates a funny comedy that has some real highlights, though he still has a big mess on his hands from a pretty poorly structured plot and forced political message that is not told well.
Licorice Pizza -5 
Great Direction (was able to get a lot out of very inexperienced actors), Very Good Acting (Great to Incredible from Alana Haim (really embodied the character and was able to carry her performance through her facial expressions, mannerisms, and vocal inflection), Very Good from Cooper Hoffman (able to play the immaturity aspect of his character very well and you can tell he will be a great actor and is his father's son), Great from Bradley Cooper (even though he is in the movie for very little, he really carries his scene and shows how great of an actor he really is), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (the plot was structured in 4 pseudo vignettes that were decently connected together (though it could have been better connected), but the movie is less focused on its story and more about its atmosphere and characters), Great to Incredible Screenplay (the dialogue was extremely conversational and had a great mix of dramatic/comedic moments, the screenplay was written very well to suit the mood of the film being a bit of a plotless "hangout" movie), Very Good Score/Soundtrack (helped play to the times of the setting), Great Cinematography (really liked the tracking shots used to help show the character as they navigate through the scenes, also used shot/reverse-shot and other camera transitions to help show perspective), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing (was used in tandem to help show perspective in the movie), Plot Structure was very different but handled decently well (4 smaller stories that ultimately ended in a final climatic moment (no real resolution); the fourth story (the mayor one) was a bit dragging so I would have liked to have seen this one cut by about 10ish minutes to make it more consistent with the other stories), Pacing was good for the most part (was dragging in the final story so I would have liked to have seen this one cut a bit), Build up to the climax was very stylistic of 60s-70s movies and I really liked how they did it (was very true to the tone and true to the times); climax itself was a real epiphany moment for the characters as they figured out what they truly wanted, Tone of the movie was established throughout very nicely as the movie was meant to be a hangout movie and not very deep in its meaning (I personally feel that this movie was what Once upon a Time in Hollywood tried to be, but better). Overall, a great movie and a very fun watch as we get to see these young characters grow through the different adventures they go on as PT Anderson delivers a great hangout movie that shows why he is one of the most respected filmmakers in the business by getting the most out of his script and elevating very new actors.
Nobody 21 
Decent to Pretty Good Direction (Was able to move the story forward decently well even though he could not get the most out of his actors, action scenes were pretty well coordinated), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting overall (Good from Bob Odenkirk, Decent to Pretty Good from RZA, Decent to Pretty Good from Christopher Lloyd, Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (mainly due to inexperience)), Pretty Good Story (it is kinda just an ex-army, John Wick Copy), Decent Screenplay (kinda bland dialogue overall though), Score was not rememberable, Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing (Felt kinda cheap, though the repetitive editing in the beginning is very symbolic in a way that Requiem for a Dream had those sequences), Plot Structure followed the same generic plot structure of a John Wick/Action Movie, Pacing felt very fast (the movie was less than 90 minutes), Build to the climax was very good as it is a culmination of all the action that Odenkirk's character had in him; Climax was good as it was the most action packed moment of the entire movie and was well choreographed, Tone of the movie was very dark and grungy (adds to that John Wick feel), the action scenes were well choreographed as a whole and shared a very similar stylistic choice to John Wick. Overall, a decent watch that was filled with action, though it entirely feels like a John Wick copy (which makes sense given who made the movie).
Belfast 21 
Very Good to Great Direction (Able to use different camera angles to show perception very well and get the most out of his actors in the cast), Very Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Caitríona Balfe (the change in opinion she has throughout the movie really shows her testament to her home and keeping her family together), Very Good performance from Judi Dench (mastered the Irish accent very well), Very Good from Jamie Dornan (He was able to give a surprising performance to help be the leader (both moral and physical) of the family as he tries to do what is best), Good to Very Good from Ciarán Hinds, Good to Very Good from Jude Hill (he captured the innocence of the character very well), ), Pretty Bad to Decent Story (There really does not feel like a story as the conflict is only subtly introduced and not really shown to impact the characters that well throughout the movie), Good to Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue was very good and true to the region and the symbolism is evident throughout), Score was just present (nothing memorable), Great Cinematography (The different camera angles really added to the depth of the movie, use of selective color with a black and white lense really highlighted choices and helped with the stylistic feel of the movie), Decent Sound (sometimes felt it was off), Good Editing, Plot Structure was pretty minimal and kinda pointless (the movie is trying to build to something but really has no plot to help with building to that point), Pacing was a bit slow as certain moments really feel like they were dragging on (did not help that certain story elements were kinda pointless), Build to the climax was prevalent but not terribly rememberable; climax was good as it showed how far gone Belfast really is and sparked the decision for the family to finally decide their fate, Tone of the movie stayed consistent throughout as it really played to the coming-of-age story theme with a backdrop of social and political unrest. Overall, a pretty good movie that is filled with many highlights in direction and acting but feels pretty boring as the plot is very minimal and has nothing memorable to go off of.
The Batman 1 
Pretty Good Direction (On a macro scale, Reeves did a Great job in setting the tone and laying out the different concepts he wanted from the movie, but on a micro scale, it felt like some of the conversations were not fluid and it felt like a lot of the pieces did not connect), Good Acting (Good from Robert Pattinson (He embodied the Batman role very well as you could tell how committed he was to playing the capped crusader (though physically it seemed he did not work out for it); though, he was not that convincing as Bruce Wayne (a big issue with the movie)), Good from Zoë Kravitz (played the mystery of Selina Kyle very well and stole a good amount of scenes (though some scenes were questionable performances)), Good to Very Good from Paul Dano (for the first 3/4 of the movie it felt like he was really stealing the show, but the final 1/4 of the movie, his performance really falls apart from being the menacing serial killer he is and to becoming a discord mod), Very Good from Jeffrey Wright (Felt like a perfect casting and played the strengths of this role very well), Very Good from Colin Farrell (A real transformation and embodied the character very well (even though it was a bit over the top)), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (Felt very true to the comics and did a great job in putting together a realistic interpretation of Batman), Good Screenplay (The symbolism was prevalent and very well executed in showing its importance, though the dialogue felt very forced and not natural at all), Decent Score (Felt this was kind of a miss from the movie was it felt like the same motif playing over and over again and really takes a back seat to the iconic scores from the previous Batman movies), Great Cinematography (The shift between general shots and reaction shots in the action scenes was a good stylistic choice, and the overall general shots taken was executed very well, but the intentional blur was a bit questionable at points), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Except for a few scenes, overall really liked how a lot of the effects were done without CGI), Great Production Design (Gave an overall dark Gotham feel that the movie was looking for), Very Good Costumes (With the Serial Killer-esque Riddler Costume being the best, Batman had a very realistic costume), Plot Structure was fine for the first 3 acts but as soon as the it starts to get close to the climax (final 1/4 of the movie) it really starts to fall apart with the ending being kinda pointless and a bit boring, Pacing felt good for the most part but for the final third of the movie it really hits how slow and dragging it is (Could have definitely cut 30-40 mins of the movie), Build to climax not good as it feels like (SPOILER ALERT) as the interrogation scene is a bit pointless with nothing being added to the story except for the fact that (SPOILER ALERT) the riddler still won; climax was pretty boring as there were moments in the actual fight scene where it felt like Batman took very questionable moves (Also it just felt like Batman was fighting a bunch of Discord/Reddit mods), Tone was set very nicely as it felt very dark and very Neo-Noir esque in its presentation and dialogue. Overall, a movie that has the potential to set up a good new Batman film series but suffers from a lot of flaws in its first encounter; it will be interesting to see where we are taken next as we follow this new, darker version of Batman.
Nightmare Alley -13 
Very Good to Great Direction (Was able to progress the story forward not only from a macro scale but on a micro scale as well (though there were some blimps on that micro scale (some of the scenes felt kinda like filler and empty space))), Pretty Good to Good Acting Overall (Good to Very Good acting from Bradley Cooper (Played the character very well, the issue was it was more of a mysterious character that only comes out towards the end of the movie (Especially the last 5 minutes)), Good to Very Good from Cate Blanchett (it felt like a lot of the prep/performance was borrowed from her portrayal as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator), Good from Toni Collette, Good from Willem Dafoe, Pretty Good from Rooney Mara (Kinda a boring character altogether), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Good to Very Good Story (A story surrounded in mystery and the passage of time is handled very well through its subtle details, though it may just be the source material because it almost feels like nothing major is happening throughout), Good to Very Good Screenplay (The symbolism is prevalent and the screenplay is pretty true to the time), Decent to Pretty Good Score, Brilliant Cinematography (Possibly one of the best shot movies I have ever scene, the transition and camera angles used to help tell the story was honestly breath-taking), Pretty Good to Sound, Good Editing, Good Visual Effects, Incredible Production Design (It feels like this movie is from the same universe as The Shape of Water as the sets and styles feel awfully similar to that movie, which is fine because the Production design for that movie was also a standout), Plot Structure is laid out very well as it is easy to follow where we are in the story and which part of the narrative arc we are, Pacing was slow and consistent throughout the movie (not a bad thing), Build to climax was very good as it was show overtly why the climax was important and what built up to it; climax was shown very well as it symbolizes the downfall of Cooper's character as he get's himself in too deep, Tone of the movie was very good as the Neo Noir style added to the historical and dark feel of the movie that was mysterious throughout, It may have been an issue from the source material but did not feel as if the movie was that new or captivating in what it was trying to show (it felt like a formulaic movie that was pretty surface level). Overall, Good to Very Good movie that is visually appealing as we go through the mystery of the characters that was a fun and captivating watch, though it is a bit surface level in both its formulaic plot structure and story leaving us wanting more as it feels like nothing really happens.
This is the End -9 
Very Good Direction (Considering the entire movie was improv, I feel like Seth and Evan did an impressive Job giving starting points for the actors to work on), Very Good Acting (Movie felt like a masterclass in improv from some of the best comedic talents of the early 2010s as the chemistry with the entire cast felt very fluid with everyone building off each other effortlessly), Good Story (A sleepover type movie with the backdrop of apocalypse mixed with different motifs on faith and judgment, though story is not what really makes the movie what it is; different callbacks to the actor's previous movies was fun to see), Very Good to Great Screenplay (Given that 85% of the movie was improv, the entire movie was incredibly funny as all the jokes built off each other very nicely; Also, the biblical symbolism was a nice touch to a movie that is not meant to be taken that serious on the surface), Score was present/Soundtrack complemented the movie very nicely in both style and comedic fashion, Good Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Bad Visual Effects (Felt very low cost), Plot Structure was very nice as each segment had its purpose in progressing the story forward, Pacing was good as it kept a consistent pace (with no scenes really needed to be cut), Build to climax was very typical of movies from this time (so pretty good); climax was good as it was more important in how it is revelations for the characters rather than the action present, Tone was set very nicely through the different motifs present as the mix of comedy/apocalypse/sleep-over/religious concepts brought something new and fun to see, The reliance on improv was fun to see as it really made the movie more about the characters interacting with each other and building jokes on each other rather than the story itself. Overall, an incredibly funny movie that is a masterclass in improv from some of the most prominent comedic actors of the early 2010s as we got to see how well they work with each other to make a very disastrous, fun scenario.
King Richard -8 
Good to Very Good Direction (Cut the right anecdotes and story points to help show the relationship between Richard and his family; got a good amount out of the actors in their scenes, though it felt like there were some points where there was some idle points/awkwardness with the more minor characters), Pretty Good Acting (Incredible Acting by Will Smith (Really transforms into the character of Richard Williams as the transformation of harshness to compassion for his family is fluid throughout the entire movie), Good to Very Good from Aunjanue Ellis (Was a good scene partner to Wll Smith and had moments where she could show off her ability as well), Good from Jon Bernthal (Was more of a minor role but played it very well), decent to pretty good from the rest of the cast), Very Good to Great Story (Outlines the impact that Richard has on the careers of his daughters as his fire and compassion help fuel their tennis careers; the issue with the story is that it is a bit revisionist as it is told from the perspectives of the Williams family (given the sister's roles as Executive producers) and sugarcoats a lot of his horrible nature and kinda makes up some aspects to make it work for the drama; despite this revisionist history, I feel the story still stayed mostly true to what happened and used tennis terminology very well (especially the William's use of open stance and throwing a spiral football for their serve)), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (A bit simple in its dialogue but gets the job done in terms of moving the story forward, some of the lines feel a bit forced as the foreshadowing is very overt), Score was present/Soundtrack was fine but gave the tone a bit more of a happy go lucky type (which I personally am not too much of a fan of), Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Plot Structure was laid out very nicely as each element builds off of each other as we see the progression through Venus (as well as Serena) through their come up in the tennis world, Pacing was good as there really was not any moments where the movie felt like it was rushed or dragging (no need to cut any time), Build to climax was good as it was really building throughout the whole movie (Venus going pro); climax was good as it helped show how cut throat the tennis world can be (even for a prodigy), Tone of the movie was a bit too happy go lucky/feel-good and because of this I felt it really took away from some of the serious/angry moments of Richard Williams, a major problem of the movie was that it is really told from the perspective of Richard Williams and because of this it sugar-coats him and kinda takes away from some of the anger he really had when he worked with the media and others (though it does humanize him which was good to see as he really was trying to make his daughters the best); I did like they focused more on Venus because she really gets overshadowed by the success that Serena has gotten over the years. Overall, a movie that is fueled by the best performance that Will Smith has ever given as he transforms himself into a compassionate father that wants his daughters to succeed, though it does falter from its feel-good tone and its revisionist history given that it is told from the Williams' family perspective (though it gets a lot of small details right which I do applaud).
No Time to Die -7 
Very Good Direction (Was able to choreograph the fight and action scenes very well as well as the interpersonal dialogue heavy scenes), Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Daniel Craig (A good send-off performance for the character he is most known for as he really takes command of every scene he is in (though there are some small minor hiccups that take this from going above and beyond his other Bond performances)), Pretty Bad performance from Rami Malek (It felt very lazy and his overall acting and mannerisms did not feel that menacing as a Bond villain), Good from Léa Seydoux (A good scene partner and love interest to Bond), Very Good from Ana de Armas (even though she was barely in the movie, she plays her ditsy, Bond girl character very well), Good to Very Good from Lashana Lynch (Was able to make the most out of the dialogue she was given as she plays the up-incoming, hotshot trope well), Very Good from Jeffrey Wright (A nice return from a memorable Bond character as Wright pays to his strengths very well with this performance), Good from the rest of the main cast (though some questionable performances from some of the minor villains)), Pretty Good to Good Story (The layout of Bond coming out of retirement and why certain pieces tie together make it be a good closure to the whole Daniel Craig Bond Saga; though there were some questionable story elements towards the end (filed with predictable cliches)), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (some of the dialogue was fine but there were some elements where it was easy to predict what was going to be said and what was coming up; it was very obvious where Phoebe Waller-Bridge came in to edit the screenplay to add more comedic elements because it just felt very forced and not funny (though some of the wittier/typical Bond jokes did hit)), Very Good to Great Score (took elements of old Bond themes while also captured new themes to make it work well (this was Hans Zimmer after all)), Very Good Cinematography, Great Sound (Really enjoyed the moments where Bond's hearing is recovering in a fight from close proximity to an explosion), Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects, Plot Structure was good for the most part (I felt the exposition really help play into the trust issues for Bond, but I feel like the resolution was very lackluster), Pacing was good because even though it was a long movie the pacing was consistent for the most part (no need to cut anything), Build to climax was good because it was clear what was needed and how it was important to the story; climax was executed very nicely in terms of action (but in terms of story it was a bit cliche and predictable), Tone was constant for the most part because it tried to be the typical bond movie (but like an older bond who is coming out of retirement one last time (though the break in tone for the comedy scenes were really annoying)), The finishing touches for Craig as bond were displayed very well throughout the movie as you can see him make peace with his time as the character as he shows his experience but also shows his closure at the same time. Overall, a nice conclusion to Daniel Craig as James Bond as we get to see him close out the character on his own terms in a very action packed, emotional manner, but the movie does not really compete with his other movies like Skyfall and Casino Royale due to the subpar screenplay/story and questionable performances from Rami Malek and some of the minor characters.
Drive My Car -11 
Great Direction (The way the director was able to get the most out of his actors while also putting together different shots to help display the loneliness and trauma of the characters was great to see), Very Good Acting (Not one performance was better than another (it felt like everyone played their role the way it was meant to be written and played their part in helping display their trauma)), Good to Very Good Story (While the actual plot is minimal and a bit mismanaged, the different points that help show the characters overcoming their trauma was a nice subtle touch), Great to Incredible Screenplay (Even though it is a translation, the screenplay felt very natural and personal; it was as if the characters were letting out all of their emotions when trying to move past the hardships they felt), Score was poorly used (the movie rarely used the score as it opted for more ambient noise, but because of this it felt extremely slow; either use a score or do not use a score, do not just minimally use it), Good Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound, Good Editing, Plot Structure was not managed well (The exposition was almost 30 minutes when it could have been 15, the middle acts could have cut like 20-30 minutes as most of it is just white noise/characters not really doing anything, and the resolution kinda felt out of place as it is part of the "covid" world when it really did not need to set in a contemporary world), Pacing was bad as the entire movie felt like it was dragging (Because the movie felt like it was 30-45 minutes longer than it should, it just has a lot of emptiness in it that makes the overall move feel slower (which does not help when they do not use a score)), Build to climax was prevalent (though a bit too prevalent) as it really shows what the characters need and how they are going to get it; climax was executed very well as it is the most touching part of the movie (with the characters leaving everything out there and attempting to move on with their lives), tone was consistent throughout as it was a somber tone the mimic the state of the characters, A movie that handles dealing with trauma very well as we can see how these characters are effected by their past actions and how they are holding onto the past (which is not allowing them to move forwards). Overall, a very well made and written movie that looks at the effects of holding on to trauma and the importance of letting go as we see all the characters be parts of a well oiled machine, but where the movie really fails with its extremely long runtime and mismanaged plot structure as it really feels like the movie is dragging a lot (something the viewer has to get past to see the hidden beauty).
The Power of the Dog 8 
Very Good to Great Direction (The different choices she made were stylistically very beautiful and artistic, though I did feel she made some questionable choices more for shock value), Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Benedict Cumberbatch (A performance that showed both the harshness of a man while also highlighting his closeted nature), Very Good from Kirsten Dunst (Was able to capture a woman who spirals into a dark alcoholic state very well as the change in action from hope to losing herself is seen through her performance), Good from Jesse Plemons (was a more calmer foil to the harshness of the main character, which limited the availability he could give with this performance), Pretty Good to Good from Kodi Smit-McPhee (the character was not really written that well as it is more of a nerdy, not strong character that uses more of subtly than overt actions, but I also did not see him go above and beyond in this role either), ), Good to Very Good Story (felt the different parts of the movie were spread out pretty well and the actually closeted nature of the main character was foreshadowed throughout the movie; moreover, the subtle actions of the character really do come around full circle towards the end), Good to Very Good Screenplay (the dialogue was well written but the main point of this move is the use of its subtly (even though it may be too much) and use of heavy symbols), Very Good Score (really had that western fell and was used very effectively to help show the tense nature of a scene and to keep the movie rolling), Very Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Incredible Production Design (I really felt the location choice for filming along with the sets were very beautiful and helped capture the beauty of the west very well (a very similar feeling I got from Brokeback Mountain)), Good Costumes (really liked the western feel a lot as there was the western hardworking men juxtaposed by the elite (similar feel to Red Dead Redemption)), Plot Structure was good for the most part as the movie was effectively laid out into different acts that helped with the pacing (though the last two acts did feel very rushed), Pacing was good for the most part as I felt the score helped give it a good steady pace (but I felt that the movie is really rushed towards the end and could have benefited from 10-15 more minutes), Build to climax was extremely abrupt as it heavily relies on the audience paying attention to the subtly of the characters and what they did in their past acts; climax is more just thrown on us because the director wants us to piece together the subtly to make a conclusion on what happened (something I was not really a fan of), Tone of the movie was very harsh/western for the first 3/4 but then becomes a bit more lighter towards the end (which I was not really a fan off cause it was a little too late), The movie relies way too much on subtly as a method of communicating meaning and I feel that it is too much (causing a worse viewing experience than if it was a mix of dialogue/subtly); there is a major shift in the movie between two characters and after that point the movie really loses its charm as the pacing is very rushed and the ending is really thrown at us as we have to draw conclusions on what happened (which I really thought was a lazy tie up). Overall, a movie that is very artistic in its use of subtly and production design as we follow a cowboy come to terms with his own identity, but even though the movie is well made, it falters from relying too much on subtly and ultimately leaves the audience with more questions in the end.
Chinatown -11 
Great to Incredible Direction (Polanski really moves the story forward in the typical noir style, but adds his own twists that make this movie stand out from the rest), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Jack Nicholson (Plays his character very well as it is a character who is constantly haunted by the demons he faced in his past), Good to Very Good from Faye Dunaway (Is able to go past the damsel in distress character as she offers her own reasons to why she is doing what she is doing), Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (The different points and elements really work well with each other as the different clues foreshadow what is going to happen (as well as detail why the past is so important to the characters), the ending is really realistic of what actually may happen; but the way the actual story was laid out was a not really balanced as there were moments were it felt they were spending too much time on small things and too little time on big things), Incredible Screenplay (Very true to the noir style and the symbolism is really prevalent in not only physical form but how it effects the characters (aka the meaning of "Chinatown")), Good Score, Good to Very Good Cinematography (really enjoyed the POV shots and the moving camera), Good Sound (typical of a 70s movie), Good Editing, Good Visual Effects/Stunts, Plot Structure was not laid out in the best way (there is a lack of exposition (we are kinda just thrown into the lives of the characters), the middle parts of the movie spend a bit too much time on different smaller elements and very little time on important elements, and the ending/climax is also a bit rushed), Pacing was a bit all over the place as it can be either very slow or very fast at times (especially the end which is extremely fast), Build to climax was present but extremely fast (though i did like this to an extent); climax was incredibly short but the best part of the movie (really shows what the overall meaning is), Tone of the movie is very noir-esque and plays this very well, I understand why the movie is called Chinatown (for symbolic reasons) but for the movie to only have the final 5 minutes be the only time they are ever in Chinatown is really disappointing (like looking at it from a consumer perspective and not a filmmaker's perspective). Overall, a classic that still holds up very well as a very well written story mixed with some of the best talent of the time makes the movie a film noir that is very similar to the time in its presentation but very different in how it lays the plot together and how things finish off (though it does falter a bit in its plot structure and pacing of different elements).
Léon: The Professional 2 
Good Direction (Able to move the story forward and coordinate the action scenes nicely), Pretty Bad Acting (Decent to Pretty Good from Jean Reno (Carried out the action sequences well and had some good moments but that was pretty much it), Pretty Good to Good from Gary Oldman (Very over-the-top in this performance and felt very Nic Cage-esqe (but he did handle himself very well)), Pretty Good to Good from Natalie Portman (Given this is her first role I am impressed by the level of maturity she is able to have with a very mature script, she holds herself very well but does show her inexperience (something she definitely improves on throughout her career)), Very Bad from the rest of the cast), Decent Story (Pretty Cliche and easy to predict, also a story that has been told so many times before), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was extremely bad and felt like it was a dub of another screenplay (when it was not)), Good Score (I liked how it added to the anxiety of some of the scenes and brought tension overall), Good Cinematography, Good to Very Good Sound, Good Editing, Good to Very Good Visual Effects (More pyro than visuals, plus the blood and gore was a very nice touch), Plot Structure felt like it was very mismanaged because the rising action is completely forgotten (feels like a skip from the conflict introduction to the climax), Pacing was very bad as it felt entirely rushed (there should have been like 30 minutes added to this movie because the pacing was incredibly fast and did not leave any time for character development (I understand there is a directors cut of the movie that shows this but I can only review off of the cut that was theatrically released)), Build to climax was decent but felt extremely rushed by the inconsistent pacing; climax was executed well as the action sequences were the best part of this movie, Tone of the movie is entirely inconsistent as it just shifts from a father-daughter relationship to a lover relationship, the action sequences of this movie were the best part as you get to see why Leon is a very well trained assassin; it is important to note how disgusting the relationship between Leon and Mathilda is because it just changes from a father-daughter to a very inappropriate lover relationship which was very hard to watch at times (and apparently it was supposed to be even more sexualized). Overall, an action movie with a lot of action sequences that were carried out nicely and had good moments, but lacks a well structured plot and screenplay that could not save the themes and relationships they were trying to portray.
Citizen Kane -28 
Incredible Direction (The ability to have a control of the scene and incorporate different technical elements to provide depth and meaning (while still being the lead of the movie) is incredible, especially given the time and how groundbreaking it was), Great Acting (Great to Incredible from Orson Welles (Especially due to his other duties on the film, really was able to have a real control of the scenes he was in and provided the real larger than life character that Charles Kane was), Great from Dorothy Comingore (Was able to play the failed, drunken widow very well), Very Good to Great from the rest of the cast), Great to Incredible Story (While the story in itself was pretty plan, the storytelling and the non-linear narrative were ahead of its time and really laid the groundwork for other major movies), Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue was very of the time and written very well coupled with incredible use of symbolism through both physical objects and technical techniques), Very Good Score (very of the time), Brilliant Cinematography (Really was ahead of the time and played a major role in the storytelling, through deep focus and other techniques), Good Sound, Good Editing, Very Good Visual Effects, Good to Very Good Production Design, Great Makeup (especially the ability to make Kane look older throughout the years), Plot Structure was non-linear and laid out pretty well (something that films took from in the future), Pacing was incredibly fast to the point were it was hard to follow (like if you look away for a second and you miss so much), Build to climax was decent and it shows how Kane tries to seclude himself from everyone as he starts to see himself as a failure with power; climax was decent as it is more about the seclusion with more emphasis on the resolution than the climax, Tone was laid out well as we are trying to investigate into the life of Kane (something that may be sprung up into noir films to come), The symbolism of the movie attached with its cinematography are something to marvel as it really was groundbreaking for the time (also it is important to note the style of storytelling and how it makes deep glimpses into the fractured life of Kane). Overall, A revolutionary film that still holds up since it premiered as it incorporated many groundbreaking elements that are used by films to come as Orson Welles defines a new generation of filmmaking, even though it did run very fast to the point were it was hard to pay attention to what was going on.
Almost Famous 10 
Good Direction (Was able to move the story forward with his well written screenplay/story, but did not really get the best of his actors), Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Patrick Fugit (was able to play the child character very well but it was easy to see where his acting limits were in the more intense and dramatic scenes), Good from Billy Crudup (does a decent job in changing his emotions to fit the scenes), Very Good from Frances McDormand (Seasoned actor who plays the over-protective mom very well), Great Job from Kate Hudson (Really plays the ditsy girl well but also shows some character when trying to be more mature and have thoughts that are more than people think she's capable of), Good performance form Jason Lee (Plays the serious/comedic relief role well as he can switch from both sides very well), Good from Anna Paquin, Very Good to Great from Philip Seymour Hoffman (Plays a role very suitable to his strengths and has a good mentorship relationship with the main character), Terrible from Jimmy Fallon (It was just so hard to watch how off-beat he was and it felt like he could not read any of his lines), Decent from the rest of the cast (Anywhere from Pretty Bad to Pretty Good)), Good Story (Typical bildungsroman story mixed with different elements of early 2000s Rom-Com/Feel-good moments; the overall plot was structured well but the ending was a little too safe/feel-good for me), Great Screenplay (The dialogue was very well written and the movie flows very nicely from its different elements, the symbols and allusions to different rock elements were also nice to see), Pretty Good Score/Very Good Soundtrack (Really helped capture the feel of the early 70s and its era in Rock), Good Cinematography, Good to Very Good Sound (very noticeable in the music performances), Good Editing, Plot Structure was laid out pretty nicely but the final 40 minutes of the movie feels like it starts to fall apart with the lack of effort put in by a lot of moving pieces (it is as if the movie should have ended at the 90 minute mark because the climax and resolution feel very forced), Pacing was good for the most part (it is just that the end really does not come together very nicely because it almost alludes to doing something new but just ends up being safe in the end), Build to climax was not really there; climax was very mediocre cause it is common cliche and does not really add anything but comedic moments, Tone of the movie was handled very nicely because you are almost immersed in the early 70s culture through the language and music/really gets that feel-good feel similar to movies like Dazed and Confused, The movie is very feel-good and plays to a lot of the style that early 2000s movies had (which is fine) but it just feels like it tries to be very safe as it is going in one direction by falls apart as is corrects itself in being more safe. Overall, a well written movie that was a fun watch with some good performances but plays a little too safe and kinda falls apart towards the end.
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith 54 
Bad Direction (The actual action and fight scenes were very well choreographed but everything else was terrible (and it could be seen how helpless the actors were)), Pretty Bad Acting (Great from Ewan McGregor (Given how bad the direction was, he really stole the show with his ability to take control of his scenes and actual show emotions when others couldn't), Pretty Bad from Natalie Portman (Very emotionless performance with very little depth), Bad from Hayden Christensen (There were elements that I genuinely though he was good, but the majority was just comical and meme-worthy cause of how bad the direction he was given), Good to Very Good from Ian McDiarmid (Embodied the emperor very well and was able to switch sides very easily), Decent from Samuel L. Jackson (had limited range throughout the performance but it was easy to see where he had to let go of the direction he was given), Acting on a Spectrum from the rest of the cast (Bad from the rest of the live-action cast; Great voice acting (really brought to life the iconic performances of their characters))), Incredible Story (The actual structure and storyline was very well told cause it really bridges the descent Anakin has in being the chosen one to falling to the darkside through the illusion that it will help Padme (especially really shown in the final hour)), Bad Screenplay (To where it is memorable and iconic; None of the language was natural and felt very forced (but there are just so many memorable lines from how bad they were written that I loved it; the foreshadowing and symbolism actually is told very well (giving further proof that Lucas is a good Storyteller but terrible dialogue writer))), Incredible to Brilliant Score (One of the best John Williams scores he has ever made), Great to Incredible Cinematography (especially in the scenes where the subjects are small pieces of a large canvas), Good Editing (The cuts between different shots was Great but the transitions between scenes felt very lazy), Great to Incredible Visual Effects (Especially considering when the movie was made and a majority of it is through Green screen and effects), Incredible Production Design, Incredible Makeup, Incredible Costumes, Plot Structure was laid out very nicely as all the elements really built off of each other and every element played an importance, Pacing was great as it really kept a steady pace throughout (with no need to add or cut on runtime), Build to climax was incredible as the final hour of the movie was building to the fall of the Jedi; Climax was incredible as it was one of the best moments in Star Wars history (especially the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan fight), Tone was very typical of the prequels and Star Wars (but the darker tones were a night touch as it brought a depressing aspect with glimpses of hope), The movie was a real redemption for the prequels as we already expected the bad aspects of the movie yet we were still surprised the grandeur and level of story writing which makes this movie an iconic story in the Star Wars saga. Overall, An incredible story with the technical achievements that really make this movie a must watch and a favorite of mine as it helps bridge the prequels with the original trilogy, even though it does reek of the bad dialogue and direction that the rest of the prequels suffer from.
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness 6 
Good Direction (Was able to take control of the different action scenes as well as the different character building scenes, all while sprinkling in different elements of horror that makes Sam Raimi famous), Good Acting (Very good from Benedict Cumberbatch (Continued his role as he now has the weight of carrying the Marvel franchise in this new phase), Good from Elizabeth Olsen (While there were many holes/I did not like her character, Olsen did a good job in trying to portray what they were going for in Wanda in this movie), Good from Benedict Wong (Standard Wong), Very Good from Xochitl Gomez (I really enjoyed her performance as she played the teenage character with potential archetype very well (and I look forward to seeing more America Chavez in latter MCU content)), Good from Rachel McAdams (played the ex-love interest very well), Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Bad Story (The entire story was very formulaic and easy to predict (took from the standard comic book boilerplate), and the Wanda Storyline was very poorly written to the point that it was more annoying than entertaining; also, there were many plot holes when it came to the multiverse), Decent Screenplay (Typical Marvel Dialogue but there were many questionable lines that were more cringey than entertaining), Good Score, Very Good Cinematography, Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Similar to previous Doctor Strange), Good Costumes, Plot Structure was very formulaic as it followed the standard MCU/Superhero boilerplate (But it spends way too much time in the exposition to where the rest of the movie does not have that much time), Pacing was incredibly fast as the shortened runtime was easy to see (would have liked to have seen 20 minutes added towards the rising action), Build to climax stood out and had good moments despite being overall pretty standard MCU; climax was the typical MCU climax (but had some moments that were very cringey), Tone was the standard MCU tone (but I did enjoy some of the horror touches and homage to his earlier horror films). Overall, a highly anticipated Marvel movie that plays too strongly to its predecessors as it is very formulaic in the MCU boilerplate and has pretty poor writing overall, but has some highlights when it comes to acting, direction, visuals, and new stylistic choices that make it a bit different from other MCU movies (even though by not a lot).
The Northman -20 
Good to Very Good Direction (I really enjoyed how he was able to progress the story forward with his use of continuous camera angles and action; also, he was able to get the most out of his actors in almost every scene), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Alexander Skarsgård (Played more of a reserved character that could not get that much out of his talent, but he was still able to play his role very well and play the menacing character filled with trauma), Good to Very Good from Nicole Kidman (Her character was not showed as much as it should have but did a good job with the role she was given), Good from Claes Bang (Played the antagonist very well and was an easy target to why Amleth wanted to get revenge on him), Very Good from Anya Taylor-Joy (The accent was needing to get used to, but she was able to carry out her character very well), Good to Very Good from Ethan Hawke (Played his character well despite only being present in the beginning of the movie), Good to Very Good from Willem Dafoe (Very small presence in the movie but he had a very memorable performance due to the character being very Dafoe-esque), Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (Pretty predictable because of it being closely tied to Hamlet, but the actual elements I did enjoy), Good Screenplay (Pretty simplistic due to it being a Norse epic (and how epics usually are), but had no major holes in it), Very Good Score, Great Cinematography (Especially how there were different tracking shots during the action scenes, as well as the different angles they chose throughout the movie), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Pretty Bad Visual Effects (especially during the hallucination scenes as they felt borderline cartoonish), Good Production Design, Good Makeup (especially the use of blood to show carnage), Plot Structure was well laid out well as it was pretty simplistic (followed the generic epic/Hamlet plot structure), Pacing was good (nothing to really cut out or add), Build to climax was prevalent and carried out very well as it was something that the movie was building towards for the entire movie; climax was carried out very nicely as it was the battle/revenge that Amleth was fighting for for the entire movie, Tone was very norse/epic-esque and was carried out pretty well given that was what the director was going for, I was still a fan of what they were able to carry out even with a very simplistic source material as I am usually not a fan of these types of movies. Overall, a epic that is a good watch filled with many good performances, great cinematography, and well carried out action scenes, but is still simplistic given the plot and how cliche/predictable it got at times.
Saturday Night Fever -3 
Pretty Good Direction (Able to move the movie forward and executes the dancing sequences very well, but besides this, he really does not get that much out of his actors and there are a lot of questionable scenes), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Very Good from John Travolta (In a very "John Travolta" way, a film that really puts him on the map for his exaggerated character), Decent from Karen Lynn Gorney (Has some good moments and has some questionable ones), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (A lot of the characters play the stereotypical New York Italian and it just gets so annoying to watch/listen to after a while)), Decent Story (Pretty formulaic and easy to predict, nothing really of substance), Decent Screenplay (As a whole, it is fine and gets the job done (very surface level), but there are just way to many stereotypical Italian mannerisms that it gets annoying), Great to Incredible Soundtrack (The actual songs were Incredible, but there were moments where I felt the director did not use the soundtrack properly (like reusing songs)), Pretty Good Cinematography (The cinematography comes to life in the dancing scenes as I liked the very low angle shots to show how big of a dancer Travolta's character was), Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Good Costumes (Very Disco-esque attire), Plot Structure was structured pretty well with no major problems (except the end kinda falls apart as it really could have ended 10-15 minutes earlier), Pacing was fine, Build to climax was not well done as the movie builds to the competition as if it is th the climax but the real climax is after (therefore, it just feels like it was building to nothing); climax was kinda boring as it was not what the movie was building to, Tone was very 70s/disco/New York Italian and it was made very clear with the dialogue and the mannerisms the characters have, The actual message of the movie is good but it is just so hard to believe as the character of John Travolta goes back to his foolish/degenerate ways right after as soon as he has his epiphany; also the movie really did not age well with its themes and language (but I guess it tried to portray the average New York Italian youth in that era). Overall, a movie with highlights in John Travolta's performance, soundtrack, and dancing sequences, but really has some misses in other aspects as it misses the mark in terms of its writing and other performances.
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring -10 
Great to Incredible Direction (Really moves the story forward and gets the best out of his actors as it drives the audience to be enticed with what happens next throughout the story), Great Acting (No one performance stands out as everyone acts as a unit to progress the story forward), Great to Incredible Story (really captivating on seeing how the journey progresses as we see the Fellowship go on this quest to Mordor, also the different elements of the story are very important as they comeback to play a role in the film), Great Screenplay (While the very "Middle English"-esque text is hard to follow sometimes, the actual dialogue is very well written as we see the director use it well to help tell the story (especially in the narration parts); also, the symbolism throughout the movie (specifically, about a boy who is trying to grow up and be a hero trope)), Great Score (with memorable themes), Pretty Good Cinematography (While for the most part it was very good at capturing the scenes, I found the slow-shaky shots incredibly annoying), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (While there were some hiccups, the CGI was incredible for its time), Great Production Design, Great Makeup, Very Good Costumes, Plot Structure was well laid out as it is about a 1/3 of a full-length story (and treats it as such with all the elements of a solo movie, yet still taking into account there is more to go), Pacing was very fast (especially for a movie that is 3 hours long) as it felt like they were trying to fit so much in (which does make sense given how dense the books are), Build to climax was good as we get to see them embark on one arc of their journey to Mordor; climax was well executed as we get to see the sacrifices the characters have to make to go on their quest, Tone was stereotypical of the fantasy genre (as it treated as such), Given this movie is the first of three parts Peter Jackson does a great job in setting the story and the conflict that the other movies will take off from as we see the internal struggles present in all the characters and the importance of what is needed to be done from the quest (so it is acceptable to treat the movie as an overall exposition even though it has elements of a solo movie). Overall, a great introduction into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy as the execution and different parts are well done to start this epic story off as the audience is left wanting more from the characters and the story as they transition into the next part.
Top Gun 11 
Pretty Good Direction (Directed the action scenes pretty well but all the other scenes just reeked of the 80s and its style), Pretty Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Tom Cruise (Played the hot head pretty well and really made it known the presence he had in every scene, but showed his inexperience when it came to different scenes (very Tom Cruise esque performance overall)), Good from Kelly McGillis (Played the love interest trope well and had some depth to her character, but was pretty limited in how well she could show how much she loved her counterpart), Good from Val Kilmer (Played the rival character trope the best he could, but was very limited in how much emotion he could show overall), Good from Anthony Edwards (Played the comic relief sidekick well and showed the more moral/cautious side that Maverick needed to go to as he tried to pull him away from being being reckless, but had some really questionable delivery of lines with some of his material (which may not necessarily be his fault)), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (Was pretty standard for the first 2/3 of the movie and was very predictable (especially how 80s it was), but the moments building up to the climax were a bit new and something that I did not expect, though the ending was very predictable in the end; did do a good job in calling back different elements of the story throughout the movie; also the movie does do a good job at character writing for the fighter pilots as you do care for them), Pretty Good Screenplay (The actual dialogue was very 80s and pretty basic/surface level, but there were iconic lines and moments that I did enjoy; also, the minor use of symbolism was a nice touch for writing that was overall pretty surface level), Great Score/Soundtrack (The actual songs/score was Great to Incredible but the use of it was the problem as it felt like the kept overusing the same songs/themes throughout the movie (to the point were it got annoying)), Very Good to Great Cinematography (especially in the flight scenes and given the time), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Very Good Visual Effects, Good Costumes (especially the fighter-pilot attire), Plot Structure was very generic and pretty boilerplate with most movies of the 80s (everything but the building to the climax was very predictable and even that was pretty standard once you knew the direction they were going), Pacing was good (the issue was that the movie just jumps at different points in the plot (which makes the audience think that 20 minutes could have really been added to bridge these gaps in plot)), Build to climax was the most unique part of the movie as it is good as it follows the standard buildup to a fight that many 80s movies do; climax was well done as it was a dogfight that the movie really builds to throughout the movie/what the audience really wanted to see; the execution of the scene was well done, Tone was incredibly 80s and that was what the movie was kinda known for (a fun movie about fighter pilots who have friendships and relationships with the people around them). Overall, an iconic movie that is a fun watch but really does reek of the 80s with its writing and acting as the audience has to get past the pretty simple plot to see the moments that make Top Gun a famous movie for its time.
Top Gun: Maverick -1 
Very Good to Great Direction (Handles the action scenes very well through direction of actors and camera angles and handles the non-fighting scenes very well as he is able to get the most of his actors as they get into their characters), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Tom Cruise (Carries where he left off from his original portrayal of the character but provides more depth into a very shallow character initially; really shows the growth in Tom Cruise's ability as while he does play his typical character, he has more range in what he can do with what he is provided), Good to Very Good from Miles Teller (Carries his own very nicely and fills that void that Goose left, also adds his own flair to the character to make it an heir apparent), Good to Very Good from Jennifer Connelly (Played her strengths very well as she played the love interest trope using her experience as an actress, also looked very stunning), Good to Very Good from Jon Hamm (An experienced actor that plays his role well), Good from the rest of the cast), Good to Very Good Story (While the actual storyline mimics the original and it pretty simplistic, there are many callbacks to the original story that I really did like), Good to Very Good Screenplay (Pretty simple dialogue, but the allusions to past Top Gun moments with the different symbolism aspects make it for an improvement on the first movie), Good Score/Soundtrack (Something that the first movie has over this as everything that is new just is not as good as the original, but they do use a good amount of the original's material (making it nostalgic)), Incredible Cinematography (Especially in the fighter pilot scenes as the POV shots really are well made to show the pilot's reactions along with their surroundings, also the different angles used to help show emphasis were a nice touch), Incredible Sound (as shown in the fighter pilot scenes), Great Editing, Great Visual Effects, Good to Very Good Makeup (Only worth mentioning because of how good Jennifer Connelly's hair was throughout the movie), Very Good Costumes (Noticeable because of the pilot attire), Plot Structure was pretty standard (mostly follows the original with some touches every now and then) but does put balance on the most important parts of the movie (especially towards the end), Pacing was great for the most part as it was steady and helped keep the audience engaged, Build to climax was great as it helps build the tension that Maverick has throughout the movie and how much he really does trust and care for Rooster (something that really builds throughout the movie); climax was incredible as the final 40 minutes of the movie are incredibly captivating with the action/fighter pilot scenes and other parts (really is a must watch with its execution as well and is by far the best part of the movie), Tone is pretty nostalgic overall as it is Maverick looking back at trauma he has faced and trying to make this right this time (so kinda a redemption style movie), One of the best legacy sequels I have ever watched as it plays the line between alluding back to the original while still providing something new very well (making this movie also way better than the first). Overall, a great action movie that is far better than the original as it builds off of the first movie very well through its well executed action/fighter pilot scenes and improved personal scenes, making this legacy sequel a must watch to relive old memories created from the original movie.
Morbius -9 
Terrible Direction (I do not understand how someone could do this bad of a job at directing, it was as if every scene was off and there was no consistent tone of style the director wanted to go for), Very Bad Acting (Pretty Bad to Bad from Jared Leto (A performance that had so many questions overall with what he was doing as it was very over-the-top/forced and not well executed (but he did show moments where he is someone who can act (its just that that was not the majority of the film))), Terrible to Very Bad from Matt Smith (His performance was just borderline annoying and really did not help with being the foil/villain to Morbius, it was just hard to believe overall cause of how questionable it was), Bad from Adria Arjona (She did have some range of emotion, but this did not save her from giving a phone-in performance that really did not play that much to the story at all as a love-interest), Pretty Bad from Jared Harris (His performance was actually the best because of how bad everyone else was, he really just was a neutral character that did not provide any value with what he did), Terrible to Very Bad from Al Madrigal (He just did not match the tone of the movie because he tried to be funny when it was serious and vice versa, and because of this his performance just felt so off and was hard to watch at times (so this bad performance maybe just a by-product of the movie being bad and inconsistent)), Very Bad to Bad from Tyrese Gibson (He just lacked any effort as it felt very phoned-in and effortless when he was trying to be serious and find truth), Terrible from the rest of the cast), Terrible Story (There is just so many jumps and assumptions made to the audience that the story does not come together at all (this can be especially be seen as Morbius just knows he has these powers without even showing us how he got them); also, there is just so many plot holes and boring moments that the writing really shows how bad it is), Terrible Screenplay (The dialogue is horrible and so unnatural that its borderline laughable that someone actually wrote this; also, the attempts at humor were so bad as it just left awkward silence rather than having the audience laugh; moreover, the character writing is terrible as you do not care about any of the characters introduced in this movie), Bad Score (it is just so poorly used and written as serious themes play during comedic moments and vice versa; also the score is just so loud at times that you can barely hear the dialogue), Terrible Cinematography (It felt like a fan made movie with how shaky and amateur the cinematography was), Bad Sound (It was so poorly mixed that I could barely hear the characters as times), Bad Editing (the actual different cuts and transitions between scenes was so poorly done it felt like this movie was made in Windows movie maker), Terrible Visual Effects (it was over-saturated throughout the entire movie and just felt extremely cartoony at times), Plot Structure was really poorly laid out as it spent no time in its exposition and developing the character to where once the climax comes the audience is just so confused with how Morbius got his powers and developed as a character; also there is no exposition as the movie just ends on a cliffhanger, Pacing was incredible fast and mismanaged to the point where the movie is incredibly short and there are so many questions left when the movie ended (if the movie was good I would have wanted to have seen like 30-40 more minutes, but I would not wish anyone to see 30-40 minutes more of this movie), Build to climax is nonexistent as we just get there with no background with how we are there; climax was horribly executed as we find out we were in the climax after the movie ends; also the actual fighting and over-saturation of CGI made it so boring and hard to watch, Tone was incredibly inconsistent as the moments where it was meant to be funny it tries to be serious and vice-versa (it was as if the director had no idea what type of movie he wanted to create), This movie is not bad to where it is funny it is just bad to where it is just so interesting how it even go made. Overall, one of the worst movies ever created with how much money was put into this and the output they got as there is not a single good thing to say about this movie (and I really hope nobody has to go through the struggle of having to see it, even for the meme).
Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope 55 
Very Good Direction (The actual moving of the story and making sure all pieces come together is incredibly managed and executed, it is just the actual direction of characters was pretty poorly done (which kinda reveals the truth that George Lucas is a visionary in storytelling, but not that Great in actually directing people)), Very Good Acting (Good to Very Good from the Live-Action Cast; Very Good to Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (Really excelled at playing the naive kid who is interested in helping very well, shows a bit of inexperience but that is to be accepted when he is playing a very young character that is the hero), Very Good to Great from Harrison Ford (The real star of the show in all his scenes as his smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (though there are moments that are kinda iffy with the awkwardness and silence from line deliveries)), Pretty Good from Carrie Fisher (Her performance does not compete with the others but she does play the damsel in distress character trope very well (though it is a bit annoying when she is changing between accents as it sounds like she is putting on a fake English accent at times)), Pretty Good to Good from Peter Cushing (Not really that much in the movie despite his high billing), Great from Alec Guinness (Really shows his experience as an actor in this performance as he has much range in showing both care for Luke yet trauma from his past that still effects him), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (Really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (Created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Brilliant Story (Created a world that is one of the most iconic today; the character writing is incredible as they are some of the most iconic characters in pop culture; the way the story ties all the different movies together (both prequel and later films) is very well done and visionary), Very Good Screenplay (The actual dialogue was not that well written as it felt very unnatural (as was seen from the characters trying to say the words), but where the screenplay shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines, and character writing to introduce the Star Wars universe as a cinematic achievement), Brilliant Score (One of the most iconic scores in cinema history and is very well used throughout the movie), Great Cinematography, Incredible Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life), Very Good to Great Editing, Cannot rate Visual Effects (The original Visual Effects were incredible for how revolutionary they were at the time of the release, but the added CGI from the re-release makes it very hard to watch as it just feels so forced and out of place with the original effects), Incredible Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as each piece builds on the previous one as everything matters in building up the movie and moving the story forward (so nothing to really add or remove), Pacing can be a bit slower at times but does maintain a very steady pace throughout the movie (pace very typical of movies from that time-period), Build to climax was very well done as the movie treats the actual build as the climax (so we are building to this build very nicely throughout the movie); Climax was kinda thrown at us as in the grand scheme of things we did not build to this (we built up to the build as previously stated) but it was very well executed and really shows off the technical marvels that the original film was very groundbreaking for; moreover helps provide some insight into Luke's quest in finding the force and taking his first step in becoming a Jedi, Tone was that typical to a space opera or science fiction epic but does have some unique feel to it that makes it very Star Wars, A ground-breaking movie not only in Cinema-history but actual history as well as it ushered in a new way to view and create stories and was an inspiration for the rise in the Science-Fiction genre in the 80s and 90s. Overall, an important movie to watch in what created one of the most iconic franchises in the world and helped jump-start a story that is beloved by many through its technical achieves and story-writing, even though the direction is a bit lacking.
The Graduate 10 
Great Direction (Really was able to get a lot from his actors and used the different camera angles and editing to help tell the story and get the most out of a movie that is very simple on paper), Very Good Acting (Great from Anne Bancroft (Really plays the dynamic of the older person trying to take advantage of the younger very well while also showing a range of emotion when trying to protect her daughter, overall showed her experience with this role), Very Good from Dustin Hoffman (Started off very slow as it was not that believable that he could be an anxious young adult, but he got better and better as the performance went on as he really began to steal the show the further the movie progressed and he got more comfortable (an analogy to his character in the movie itself)), Good to Very Good from Katharine Ross (shows up pretty late into the movie but does show some range in her character towards the end as she begins to have feelings for Hoffman's character), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast), Very Good Story (A tale of two movies: the first part dealt with the uncertainty of graduation and did a good job doing so as the main character dives deeper into exploring his independence, the second part deals with the more typical rom-com movie of parents disapproving of this love/love-triangle; while the transition between these two parts is very abrupt as it does not flow well, the connection between the beginning and the end is better), Very Good Screenplay (the actual conversational dialogue is very well written (with iconic lines), but some of the lines are a little too on-the-nose (like when he talks about not knowing his future); the symbolism of water is also used throughout as it helps provide truth and wash away sins committed from the past), Great Score/Soundtrack (Uses three different songs for the different parts of the movie and does a good job building themes and renditions that weave into the story very well, also the songs are very iconic in themselves), Incredible Cinematography (Especially the different angles they used and the mirroring techniques they had (something that is very ahead of its time)), Very Good Sound, Incredible Editing (The transition between shots was very seamless and really seemed groundbreaking given when this movie was created (examples of this are when Hoffman's character transitions from going to the pool to seeing Mrs. Robinson and some of the Hotel scene shots)), Plot Structure was not the best structured as it felt like a movie with in two big parts (the Ben-Mrs.Robinson relationship and the Ben-Elaine relationship) with the last part into itself being split into two parts (so this makes the movie feel very unbalanced in its structure as it favors the first part a lot), Pacing was not that well maintained as the first half felt fine but the second half felt like it was dragging as it starts when a typical rise to the climax should happen (so 15-10 minutes could have between cut from the first half to make it seen more balanced), Build to climax was well done as it pretty standard for the typical Rom-Com (but since this is a movie from the past it may be that other later films have taken from this so that actually might make it revolutionary); climax was a bit chaotic as so much happens at once and kinda makes it hard to concentrate (also it is very fast); the movie also kinda ends abruptly with no conclusion (but that may be intentional for symbolic purposes), Tone was actually well established as it shifts from uncertainty to having a clear vision (with both being the guise of a rom-com), For a movie that is over 50 years it is very groundbreaking in what it does with direction/cinematography and is a pioneer in the rom-com genre that many movies later on most likely take from. Overall, a movie that is a very good watch and has things to watch for (like direction and acting) as we get to see Dustin Hoffman enter the Hollywood scene with a very comedic movie that is groundbreaking in the rom-com genre, but the film suffers from a very imbalanced plot structure as it favors the Mrs.Robinson relationship a lot more than it should.
Project X -71 
Pretty Bad to Decent Direction (While the execution of party scenes was well done, the actual direction of people and the other scenes were really hard to watch at times and very poorly executed), Bad Acting (Bad from Thomas Mann (Just a very cringy performance and clearly shows inexperience), Decent from Oliver Cooper (the best of the main characters as he tries to be the comedic relief character that the movie tries to pent up as, but kinda hits sideways a lot as his inexperience shows), Decent to Pretty Good from Miles Teller (Actually showed some talent in this minor performance and really shows how he is capable of being a star in the future), Bad from the rest of the cast (just showed so much inexperience and felt very cringy at times)), Pretty Good Story (The actual plot was very poorly structured but the different themes and ideas used went on to be very iconic and play a major role in the youth at the time), Bad Screenplay (The lines/jokes were stuff that middle schoolers were saying in 2012 (not high schoolers) and the other parts of the screenplay were so predictable and corny/cringy), Great to Incredible Cinematography (the cinéma vérité style/found footage really was what stole the show as it was well done (not nauseating like other files of this style) and really made it so it felt that the audience was at the party), Good Sound, Very Good Editing (especially during the party montages), Good to Very Good Visual Effects (the pyro for the movie was well done), Plot Structure was so poorly managed (the exposition and rising action is like only 20 minutes of the movie as it places way more emphasis on the party, and because of this the actual party feels like it drags for so long because it really does not build up that much), Pacing was incredibly fast as they really try to fit so much in (they should have added 30 minutes to before the party to help build it up), Build to climax was poorly executed as it is a by-product of a poorly structured plot; because the movie focuses too much on the party it really cannot build up that much (though it does try); climax was decent but is kinda a mess as it is just chaos at the end of the party-goers and really does not get that much done, Tone was the typical high school comedy movie, Very Good to Great Score/Soundtrack (really paved the way into being the party soundtrack of the early 2010s as many of these songs are still used today for partying (really showing the impact this movie had)); the movie does have impact (given how much it was talked about and discussed by the youth when it came out and how much impact it has on parties and clubs today with the music and movie references) but it is a blatant copy of Superbad (it stars the same three characters (though they are all poorly written versions of those three) who try to become popular by having a party and end-up screwing up with the people they love as they reconcile towards the end (the only difference with this movie is that it is more about the actual party rather than the journey)). Overall, an impactful movie for its time that is shot very well but is so poorly written that it is really hard to watch at times, and the movie is a copy of Superbad and it really shows.
Saving Private Ryan -1 
Incredible to Brilliant Direction (The way he was able to conduct shots and scenes on a mass scale was a masterclass as it was truly a spectacle to watch the grotesque nature of war as it places its subjects into mass trauma; the interpersonal scenes were also well carried out as he is able to capture the trauma the characters are experiencing through World War II), Very Good to Great Acting (Great from Tom Hanks (does a great job in portraying the leader who has to move past his present trauma to lead his men (really commands all the scenes he is in)), Very Good to Great from Matt Damon (Although he is not in the movie for long, he really does a good job in portraying the emotion of someone who has so much to live for yet has already lost so much), Very Good to Great from the rest of the cast (everyone (even Vin Diesel) plays their part very well no matter how big or small it is)), Good Story (At its core it is pretty simple as it is just the characters going on a mission that they do not want to go on (but have to to serve their country); but the different elements of the character's journey was a good touch to see), Great Screenplay (The dialogue was very well written and naturally flowed from the characters and the use of symbolism in trying to find purpose greater than one's self as well as dealing with trauma was very well written), Very Good Score, Incredible Cinematography (And this shows during the war scenes (especially D-Day)), Incredible Sound, Great Editing, Brilliant Visual Effects (Especially the ability to capture the gore of war), Great Makeup (In helping show the dirt and gore of war), Plot Structure was managed well as the movie really starts with a 30 minute prologue of D-Day followed by the actual movie (which is well structured), Pacing was good for the most part (though some of the middle conflict could have been cut by like 10-15 minutes to help with length), Build to climax was incredible as it shows the mission coming to a close (but not fully completed); climax was well executed as it really symbolizes the scarifies the characters make for the country and those who are and are not willing to put their body on the line to defend it, Tone was a war movie mixed with one of character's dealing with trauma as both aspects synergize to create a well made tone that keeps the audience captivated, One of the best representations of War and Trauma I have seen as the gore and dangerous elements of the war paint a realistic picture of how traumatic the overall experience was for the characters and how they have to go through it to finish their job. Overall, and incredible movie that is a must watch to see the effects trauma has on soldiers of war who want to get out but cannot due to the duty they have to serve to their country.
The Imitation Game 5 
Good Direction (Gets the job done and is very similar to that of other British Bio-pics (nothing amazing or bad)), Good Acting (Incredible from Benedict Cumberbatch (Really embodies the character very well as he commands every scene he is in to bring to life an important figure in history), Good to Very Good from Keira Knightley (While her performance is not incredibly impactful, she does stand out from the rest of the cast as she is able to be a good scene partner to get the best out of Cumberbatch in their scenes together), Good from Matthew Goode (Really brings the wit and comedic charm to the movie as he acts as a rival/colleague to Alan Turing), Good from Mark Strong (Plays the typical Mark Strong character but is fine in his role for this movie), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast (very British Bio-pic/BBC esque in their acting)), Good to Very Good Story (Helps paint the life of Alan Turing well (though with many elements fabricated) and shows the struggles he had to go through in his personal life as he was excelling in his public one), Good to Very Good Screenplay (Mixes wit with dialogue very well), Good Score, Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Plot Structure was decent for the most part but really kinda falls off given the climax happens with almost 20-30 minutes left in the movie (making the rest seem like it is dragging), Pacing was a bit on the slower side (with the last 20-30 minutes really dragging; could have probably cut this section in half), Build to climax was there and decently executed; climax was decently executed but happens a bit too early into the movie, Tone was very british biopic-esque as it is very similar to other films in this genre. Overall, a good movie that presents an important story in history (Alan Turing) and is carried by an incredible performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, but is pretty simplistic in execution and drags a bit towards the end.
Jaws 3 
Good to Very Good Direction (for an amateur director at the time, he does a really good just in executing what he wants and how he wants to architect his movie and story; while there were some shots that were well executed, some of the horror moments really showed signs of amateur film-making), Pretty Good Acting (Good from Roy Scheider (Does a good job playing the lead of the film but really does not go above and beyond in any way), Good from Robert Shaw (Plays his role well but is a bit discombobulating at times), Very Good from Richard Dreyfuss (The most animated out of all the characters and shows a full range of emotion that goes above and beyond the other characters), Pretty Good to Good from Murray Hamilton (Plays the Town Mayor who is unethical trope and has no major issues in the performance), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (A revolutionary story for movies that came after it but is pretty simplistic in what actually happens), Pretty Good Screenplay (Even though there are iconic lines, the overall screenplay was a bit simple and bland, with some questionable dialogue at times), Great Score (Fueled by an iconic theme that is widely know today), Good to Very Good Cinematography, Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (especially for the time), Plot Structure was pretty simplistic and really lacks an resolution, Pacing was fine (no major complaints), Build to climax was present and decently executed as you know it is there; climax was well executed but was a bit long (could have been shortened for like 10 minutes and given it to a resolution), Tone was pretty similar to that of other horror-hunting movies. Overall, a groundbreaking film for its technical achievements and different elements, but is pretty simplistic in terms of writing and plot-based elements.
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers -10 
Very Good to Great Direction (Takes a step back from the previous movie as this movie is more about moving the story forward (which is does a great job at) but introduces many new things in this film that it is a bit hard to follow at times), Very Good Acting (All the performances still act as pieces to a larger part but they are not as powerful as they were in the first film (specifically Gandolf) but Gollum did improve in this movie substantially), Good to Very Good Story (The story is still very captivating but there are so many parallel plots going that introduce new story elements so quickly that is a bit confusing at times on what is happening), Great Screenplay (Similar to the first film; while the very "Middle English"-esque text is hard to follow sometimes, the actual dialogue is very well written as we see the director use it well to help tell the story (especially in the narration parts); also, the symbolism throughout the movie (specifically, about a boy who is trying to grow-up and be a hero trope)), Great Score (with memorable themes, and actually may be a bit better this movie), Very Good Cinematography (An improvement from the last film as there are more grandiose shots that are well executed), Great Sound, Very Good to Great Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (For the most part the CGI is good but there are more noticeable hiccups in this movie than the previous (especially in the mix between Live-Action and CGI)), Great Production Design, Great Makeup, Very Good Costumes, Plot Structure just feels like it is moving the story forward and not like a separate film in the trilogy (like the first film) so there really is no typical plot structure, Pacing was very fast (especially for a movie that is 3 hours long) as it felt like they were trying to fit so much in (which does make sense given how dense the books are) but unlike the last film I do not think it does as good of a job as it did in the previous one, Build to climax was good as it builds up to different epic battles that the characters must fight; climax was well executed as it goes between the different story line climaxes very well to keep the audience engaged, Tone was stereotypical of the fantasy genre (as it treated as such), This movie feels more like it is moving the story forward in the trilogy (the rising action/building the overall conflict) so it should be treated as such (making it less of a stand alone movie as the previous one). Overall, a movie that is more about building the story in the trilogy rather than being experienced on its own with it more concerned about transitioning to the next part to see how the trilogy concludes (which makes it not hit the mark as well as the previous one).
Creed II -16 
Good Direction (Was able to put together a good movie with its cut and getting the story to move forward), Decent Acting (Pretty Bad to Decent from Michael B. Jordan (Jordan plays the same character he plays in every movie (someone who feels he needs to prove doubters wrong trope) and really is one-dimensional in this performance; he is able to show emotion but he really cannot act emotional (especially in the love scenes with Tessa Thompson)), Very Good from Sylvester Stallone (Not as good as his last Creed performance but still is a vital part of the movie and a reason to watch as he continues to be the father figure to Creed while he is trying to come to terms with being a father to his actual son), Good from Tessa Thompson (The love scenes between her and Michael B. Jordan were not the best but besides that she was able to hold her own), Good to Very Good from Dolph Lundgren (really took a once 1-dimensional character and gave him more personality to where you sympathize with his struggle), Decent from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (Some elements of the story were way too safe/mismanaged (the overall plot of fighting from the perspective of Creed (like the default in the first fight)), but I did enjoy the elements when it came to Rocky (and how it closed the character's story line), Drago (and how his story closed his arc from Rocky 4), and the Baby), Decent Screenplay (The scenes when it came to Rocky and Drago were very well written and had that charm of the old movies, but all the scenes regarding just Creed and his relationship with other characters (besides Rocky) were pretty poorly written/felt unnatural), Good Score (mixed the allusions to the original movies nicely), Very Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Good Makeup, Plot Structure was a bit mismanaged as it felt they were trying to fit in a little too much into this movie and did not have enough time to do so (though the moments from building to the climax to the resolution were executed very well), Pacing was alright, Build to climax was very typical of Rocky but was overall very good (a real turning point for the movie); climax had decent execution (it was basically the same as the last movie), Tone was a little bit too much to that of a sports movie when rocky is really not about that (rocky is about someone finding themselves (it just happens to be in the context of boxing), and the touch of becoming a father was nice but really does not help too much in this regard), The emotional touches of this movie were well done and the film was an overall good conclusion to the Rocky Balboa character as he gets closure in something he has been hoping for for so long. Overall, a movie that is a good conclusion to Rocky's story line and has really good moments when it comes to his and the legacy characters, but is really held back by the Creed core in terms of the depth they can really go.
We're the Millers 5 
Pretty Good Direction (comedic elements were executed well and it was pretty similar in feel to that of comedies from that time-frame), Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Jennifer Aniston (really showed her experience in comedic acting from this role and did a good job being a presence to work off of for the other actors), Good to Very Good from Jason Sudeikis (really commanded all the scenes he was in and was the lightning rod for others to work on him), Good from Emma Roberts, Good from Will Poulter, Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast (given what their roles in the movie were and the type of movie it is)), Decent to Pretty Good Story (At its core the movie is pretty surface level in that its a fake family trying to smuggle drugs, but the overall story is funny and good to watch all the flawed characters grow in the process), Good Screenplay (Very funny movie that has some quotable lines/moments), Plot Structure was very nice and laid out well, Pacing was good as it kept a consistent pace for the most part (though it does drag towards the end (so cutting like 5-10 minutes towards the end would have really helped)), Build to climax was very typical of movies from this time; climax was good (A generic mix of 2010s action with comedic elements), Tone was set very nicely as you know it is a comedy from the way they play off the genre. Overall, a funny movie with good performances that is a fun watch that is not very serious, though the flawed characters growing from their journey is a nice touch.
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back 43 
Great Direction (The actual moving of the story and making sure all pieces come together is incredible managed and executed, and this movie is a definite improvement in directing people than its predecessor as the director was really able to get more out of his actors in their performances for this time around), Very Good to Great Acting (Very Good from the Live-Action Cast; Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (showed the progress he has made from being a naive/hopeful kid to someone more cognizant of the present and the work he needs to put in to be a better Jedi), Great from Harrison Ford (the real star of the show in all his scenes as he smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (and he really cleaned up the delivery of his lines in this movie as there are not any awkward pauses as there were last time), Good to Very Good from Carrie Fisher (She really improves this time around as she is given more freedom to play as opposed to last time; she also really grows as a character from being the damsel in distress to being a loving leader), Good to Very Good from Billy Dee Williams (Really becomes a memorable presence in all the scenes he is in with his cool nature that conflicts/competes with Han, though there is some hiccups in delivery as he is still getting used to the Star Wars universe as opposed to the other members of the cast), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship; and really grows the character to show how loving he is towards his new friends), Great to Incredible from Frank Oz (Really brought the character of Yoda to life with the puppeteering and the vocal performance, Good to Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Incredible Story (Really sets up different elements of the universe very nicely and uses the concept of parallel storylines very well; also has some of the most iconic moments of the series and does a good job in building the downfall of the characters; the only issue this time around is that it does not have the ability to build worlds like the previous film could), Great Screenplay (The dialogue this time around felt way more natural and was better written; the screenplay still shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines (with it having one of the most iconic lines/plot twists in cinema (or even narrative) history)), Brilliant Score (Takes what was great from the previous film and adds some new themes that really make this score stand out as well), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Which really stands out in the Luke vs. Vader scene), Very Good Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life, but there are some issues with Sound in this movie as there feels like a delayed sound with the lightsabers (which is very annoying if you have watched the prequels)), Very Good to Great Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (This movie does not really go overboard with the new visuals of the re-release as much as the other movies so it is easier to comment on), Incredible to Brilliant Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history, and really added to that with the Hoth/Dagobah/Bespin sets which are regarded as some of the best in all of Star Wars), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as it has three major parallel story lines that all converge to the climax and the end (something that helps keep the audience engaged to see how the different arcs are coming along), Pacing was better in this movie as it felt more consistent and not as slow as the last one, Build to climax is done very nicely as it is really pivots the franchise into seeing who these characters really are as they have to make important decisions for the future; Climax was the best part of the movie as we get to see what Luke's training has come to/seeing the rest of the crew into action as we get to see how much the characters have grown yet see how far they really are to their goals in the sage; moreover one of the most important lines in history is delivered in this climax that make Star Wars a franchise memorable, Tone does not play as much into the space opera or science fiction epic as the last one but does have shades of it; feels more like a standout movie that really transcends genre in many ways (while still keeping the same star wars charm), Really can be felt of as a stand alone movie (even though it leaves so much to be answered with its ending) as we get to see the rise and fall of the characters as they must continue their own individual quests to grow as characters. Overall, a brilliant movie that really builds on where the last movie left off and improves on it in so many ways to make it a very memorable film that is not only the best in the series but in film history as we see a more mature Star Wars in the characters that take part in it.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 5 
Very Good to Great Direction (Really enjoyed the mechanical yet cartoonish feel as it really felt like it helped set the tone of the movie being in a factory as well as it being a Roald Dahl story; also, the direction of actors was fine enough to where there were no major issues), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Johnny Depp (Really was the commanding figure that is needed from Willy Wonka; was able to switch between a cheerful yet apathetic man who is deeply effected by his past trauma very well as these transitions are seamless yet cartoony to a feel that makes sense for the movie), Good to Very Good from Freddie Highmore (plays his role well as the cheerful and hopeful boy who is the moral compass for the movie), Pretty Good to Good from David Kelly, Good from Helena Bonham Carter, Good from Christopher Lee (plays a very Christopher Lee role that is toned down a bit for a children's movie), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (In terms of how iconic of a story the film is based from, it really does a good job in painting the world created by Dahl; the only issues with the story come towards the end as it really feels to drag on as we get to the final two kids), Good Screenplay (A very cartoony, kid-friendly script that plays to a Dahl story pretty well; also, good use of foreshadowing throughout (though it makes it a bit predictable)), Good Score, Good to Very Good Cinematography (It does a good job in helping us come into this world as each of the different rooms has its own type of style (with the last kids room having a Kubrick esque approach given the movie they are watching is 2001: A Space Odyssey)), Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (though it was a bit easy to see the limitations that early 2000s CGI had in making this movie), Great Production Design (The sets really brought this film to life with its ability to tell the story of the rooms/scenes it was in), Good Costumes (More so for Willy Wonka as his costume really steals the show for the film), Plot Structure was a major issue that holds this film back because it spends way too much time in the exposition (the film gets to the start of the factory tour at the 40 minute mark) so the movie really seems to drag and become forgettable after the second child (so the movie really should have cut 15-20 minutes from the film (especially the background scenes for Willy Wonka)), Pacing is fine for a good portion but really starts to drag after the second child is over (given by the issues from the plot structure), Build to climax was pretty anti-climatic and really is not that interesting because the movie has really dragged on for so much that it is pretty hard for the audience to care; climax was pretty uneventful as it is more about Willy Wonka facing his demons rather than the actual climax for the meat of the movie (the tour), Tone was very well established as cartoony and mechanical as Burton does a really good job establishing this throughout the film; i was also a fan of the more darker approach it takes at some moments, I have not watched the original movie so it is hard for me to compare both of these movies. Overall, a good movie that is well made and driven by its Director and lead actor (Johnny Depp) as it is fun to see us go into the world of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but it suffers from a mismanaged plot structure to the point where the final 30 minutes really feels like a chore to go through.
Free Guy 0 
Pretty Good Direction (Does a good job on a macro-scale to help build the world and does a good job in moving the story forward (though in a pretty simplistic way) but kinda falters when trying to lead his actors), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Decent to Pretty Good from Ryan Reynolds (plays the typical Ryan Reynolds character), Good to Very Good from Jodie Comer (Actually shows a good amount of depth in her performance and is a real standout in terms of helping drive the story forward), Good from Joe Keery (Kinda taps into his Steve Harrington but actually does a decent job in playing a programmer who sounds comfortable in saying the technical knowledge), Bad from Taika Waititi (I get what they were trying to go for with this character but it was just way too over the top and really annoying by the end), Decent from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (the actual concept is very interesting and I think this was a surprisingly good interpretation of Sentient AI, but the movie felt a bit too formulaic and the ending was incredibly safe to where it really stained the rest of the movie), Pretty Good Screenplay (The use of technical jargon was surprisingly very good and pretty realistic to what programmers actually say, but the rest of the dialogue was pretty generic; the jokes were pretty clever and had a lot of innuendoes that were targeted towards older audiences/gamers), Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (especially the ability to make it look like a video game), Plot Structure was fine and laid out pretty well (though it is a bit formulaic), Pacing was fine, Build to climax was good given that it is pretty formulaic to that of other action movies; climax was captivating and fun to watch (it is just an issue with the transition to post climax/ending), Tone was that of a action movie but had some mixes of video game culture, The biggest issue I had with the movie was how safe the ending was as it is something from the late 00s/early 10s and really makes the movie feel like it built towards nothing. Overall, a fun watch that plays into the tech/gamer world pretty well, but falters from a simplistic delivery and a safe ending.
Minions: The Rise of Gru -45 
Decent Direction (Able to move the movie forward and keep the audience captivated enough), Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Steve Carell (Commands all the scenes he is in and has the iconic Gru voice but does not really change his inflection so much to portray a younger version of Gru (still kinda just sounds like Gru)), Good from Pierre Coffin (really is able to make the Minions really adorable with the different voices and inflections he is able to do), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Decent Story (Nothing really spectacular as it is a pretty predictable plot that is harmless for a children's movie), Pretty Good Screenplay (Simplistic yet adorable as it is tailored more for the audience to care and laugh at the minions, also more suited for the younger audience), Decent Score/Soundtrack, Pretty Good Sound (helps bring the minions voices to life), Pretty Good Editing, Good Animation (really is a unique style that Illumination has as it really helps bring the minions to life), Plot Structure is pretty formulaic and predictable (but it is nice to see them do a parallel narrative structure), Pacing was extremely fast (given that the movie is only 88 minutes, there should have been at least 10-15 minutes added), Build to climax was very formulaic and predictable; climax was pretty predictable, Tone was that of a kids movie but it did have flavors of 70s blaxploitation, It needs to be studied how much of an impact social media had on getting everyone to go to the movies as it was incredible to see the reception this movie got on Tik Tok and Twitter from Memers. Overall, its just a kids movie with adorable moments, but not that serious of a movie (even though the social media marketing has made it an importance to go see this movie (which I do love)).
Elvis -7 
Pretty Good Direction (Did a decent job in getting the most out of his actors and was able to help build the overarching narrative very well, the issue was the actual plot points felt very rushed and jammed in to where it really was hard to help move the story forward; also, feels very similar to his other movies in terms of style (at least The Great Gatsby); another issue in his direction is that he tries to build stuff up but when events actually happen they are a bit subpar/lackluster), Good Acting (Incredible to Brilliant from Austin Butler (Really embodied and encapsulated Elvis to a T, it was also incredible that he was singing for the most part (at least the younger version of Elvis)), Good from Tom Hanks (played more to his experience here as he did what he could with the character given there was really not that much for him to work with), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Bad Story (The movie does have pretty important elements in Elvis' life but tries to jam in so many different points from his life that it never does a good job in explaining any of them and just feels rushed overall; also, the movie makes a lot of liberties at changing the narrative of the true story to make it play more favorably in Elvis' way/dramatize the movie), Good Screenplay (Nothing major with the dialogue and does a good job in helping work it around Elvis, but the narration elements of the story were a bit annoying but understandable), Pretty Bad Score/Soundtrack (The actual songs were fine, it was just annoying to hear contemporary music being played in a biopic from the 50s-70s because they should have just used music from that time-period (or at least make new songs that sound like music from then) to give it a more authentic feel of music Elvis would create), Very Good Cinematography (Very similar to other Baz Luhrmann), Good Sound, Great Editing (does a good job in helping make it feel more like a storybook), Good Visual Effects (while there were some hiccups in the beginning and it can be a lot at times, I feel like overall it does a good job in helping it give that storybook feel), Great Makeup (really helped put on the weight of the actors very well), Good Costumes (Helps give that Elvis feel), Plot Structure was the biggest flaw of this movie as the movie tries to jam in so many different points into Elvis' life that it does not do a good job in explaining any of it; also it still tries to follow a traditional plot structure as it is a biopic but with everything else it really hinders it from being a well structured plot, Pacing is incredibly fast even with a 2 hour and 40 minute runtime as the movie tries to fit in too much (the movie should have cut out about 30-40 minutes and go more in-depth to the points), Build to climax was decent but a bit simplistic; climax was a captivating part of the movie but was a bit simplistic in its execution; also it was nice to see a full falling action and resolution but these elements could have been cut a bit shorter to help with the runtime, Tone was very similar to other Baz Luhrmann movies as it very extravagant in its presentation and showmanship to his other movies (which is a good thing given the subject of the movie). Overall, a movie that is carried by the performance of its lead actor in the titular performance, but is held back by its poor story writing and plot structure.
Napoleon Dynamite 12 
Pretty Good Direction (Does a good enough job in helping get the most out of his actors, even when the movie is a deadpan comedy; also, it is impressive that he was able to get the most out of the movie given such a low budget), Decent Acting (Good to Very Good from Jon Heder (Really helps encapsulate who the titular character really is and has a lot of iconic mannerisms that make this performance iconic still to this day), Good to Very Good from Jon Gries (his over-the-top, 80s nostalgic performance really helps play into the character as he is a star of the show that tries to relive memories from the past (making him the most iconic character out of all the performances)), Pretty Good from Aaron Ruell (Actually a surprisingly good performance and is a real comedic relief in the moments of deadpan, he is able to play off other characters pretty nicely), Decent to Pretty Good from Efren Ramirez (Does not really have that much to work with as his character is more of a sidekick, but is able to still make his performance memorable), Decent from Tina Majorino (Plays a very Deadpan character who is very sheltered so she is not really able to give off that much in this performance), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Decent Story (Nothing really happens in the story (and that is kinda the point) as the movie is more about seeing Napoleon in his daily life by himself), Good Screenplay (Dialogue that is filled with iconic deadpan humor and moments that really make this movie very iconic), Pretty Good Score (Helps set the tone of the movie with its quirkiness), Decent Cinematography, Decent Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Good Costumes (the movie is filled with some iconic costumes that help play into this movie being remembered still till this day (like the Vote for Pedro shirt)), Plot Structure was kinda none-existent in it is more about Napoleon doing things and building to those different moments that Napoleon is doing (and how these events do not really have much of a resolution), Pacing was a bit on the slower side (helps add to the deadpan), Build to climax was minimal but somewhat there; climax was the most iconic part of the movie but the coming down from the climax was pretty bad, Tone was extremely deadpan (the point), For such a low budget movie it is very impressive what they were able to pull off with the movie and how much of a hit/iconic movie they created. Overall, a cult classic that is an embodiment of deadpan humor as the filmmakers really tried to get the most out of what they could from a low-budget movie, and it really shows.
Blade Runner -4 
Pretty Bad to Decent Direction (He is able to move the story forward in an alright way, but the execution of the film just seems very bland with actors that are very disinterested), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Decent from Harrison Ford (A pretty lackluster performance from the lead as he really does not show any emotion throughout the entire movie (which takes away from his signature charm) and it just seems like he really does not want to be there, though there are some moments where he does do a good job), Decent from Rutger Hauer (An alright performance that has some memorable moments, but is very 80s in how it presents a villain), Pretty Bad to Decent from Sean Young (Plays a very bland and emotionless performance (which is fine for a replicant, but the point of her character is that she is not supposed to know that she is a replicant)), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Good Story (The only good part of the movie as it is a pretty well constructed plot that has memorable elements and philosophical interpretations on what it means to be alive), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (The very technical jargon was something suited for the film but the actual dialogue is a bit bland, there are also a lot of symbolism, foreshadowing, and philosophical questions created that I did like), Pretty Good Score (though iconic), Good to Very Good Cinematography (Helped create the futuristic feel), Pretty Bad Sound (Sounded very 80s and was a bit cheap), Decent Editing, Pretty Good Visual Effects (Helped with creating the futuristic feel), Pretty Good Production Design (Similar to Visual effects in its performance), Plot Structure was good for the most part and one of the better parts for the movie, Pacing was very slow (which added to how the movie felt very boring), Build to climax felt very boring as it was present but I really was not that captivated in what was going on; climax was present and a bit less boring (does have the most memorable monologue from the movie), Tone was supposed to be very sci-fi and futuristic but ended up just being a very boring tone overall with its execution, Review for The Final Cut. Overall, a movie that has a huge following and big impact on the sci-fi genre as it begs many questions about humanity and what it means to be alive, but does not live up to such a high billing as it is poorly executed by its director and actors to the point that is is pretty hard to pay attention and watch due to how boring it is.
Thor: Love and Thunder 8 
Bad Direction (Really tries too hard to be funny and really is chaotic with trying to progress the story forward), Acting (Very Good from Chris Hemsworth (Really shows the experience he has with the character and effortlessly is able to command every scene he is in), Very Good from Christian Bale (Really shows the level of dedication he goes through as an actor as he is very captivating even in this villainous role), Pretty Good from Tessa Thompson (A good comedic relief that is menacing this time around and picks up where she left off from the previous film), Decent to Pretty Good from Taika Waititi (Plays the comedic relief character and has his ups and down given the script he wrote), Pretty bad from Russell Crowe (Really was not that convincing as Zeus as his acting was not there and his accent really did not sit right (which is surprising because this role was really written for him)), Decent to Pretty Good from Natalie Portman (Tries a bit too hard in this performance and really falters when it comes to the emotional side of the character (something that is surprising to me given her experience)), Very Good from Matt Damon (It was really funny how he is able to carry on his cameo from the previous movie and have such a small role even though how big he is), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (though Good from the Guardians of the Galaxy (really just stayed on brand for their characters given how short of screen time they had))), Pretty Bad Story (The overarching story was not that bad as it deals with Thor post Avengers as he is trying to come to terms with unfinished love, it is just not that well structured and the ending really is not that good; plus the general breaks from the narrative were really sloppy and not well executed (given that it was amateur style and it really was not that funny); also, for a movie that is meant to be about Thor and Jane's relationship it does a real bad job in helping develop it (we are kinda just thrown into what happens)), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The movie tries way too hard to be funny and because of it only 1/3 jokes really hit in the movie, plus most of the lines are really predictable and bland), Pretty Good Score/Soundtrack (though it is really annoying how much they play Sweet Child o' Mine throughout the movie), Good Cinematography, Decent Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Very Bad Visual Effects (Given the budget for the movie it is really alarming how unfinished and cartoonish it looks, it looks like they did not spend any effort to change this up before the release), Good Costumes (Did a good job in the Asgardian armor), Plot Structure was a real mess as the movie tries to follow a simplistic Marvel structure but tries to be quirky with it with different breaks and changes that it really hurts with the execution; also the rising action in the character arcs was really poorly done and the resolution really is thrown at the audience and the ending really takes away at what it was trying to build, Pacing was incredibly fast (and this is from the short runtime; the movie could have really benefited from 20-30 minutes added to help with developing and building character relationships), Build to climax was fine and pretty typical of Marvel; climax was incredible formulaic and predictable to any Marvel movie, Tone was pretty 80s and i think he did a good job in helping build this (but is too meta at times with how it is like this). Overall, a movie that is poorly executed and cannot be saved with Thor's charm as it tries too hard to be funny with its meta jokes and constant volume of jokes (even when it mostly does not work) as this takes away from actually building a storyline that should really be developed, the relationship between Thor and Jane and how Thor comes to terms with being at the end of his character arc.
Snatch -13 
Decent Direction (Able to progress the story forward and cuts the film very well, but pretty inconsistent in terms of setting tone and getting the most from his actors), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (The cast as a whole is judged as it was more of an ensemble effort for the characters to help progress the story forward (Some performances to highlight were Brad Pitt in his ability to play a Pikey very well and Jason Statham who is not his typical tough guy character (though he does show a bit of inexperience with his acting))), Good to Very Good Story (Does a good job in having the different parallel story lines converge at different points to show how they were all going after the same goal but in different ways), Good Screenplay (A bit repetitive at times but there were some good foreshadowing and symbolism that was surprising for a movie like this; also the jokes and dialogue were a bit simple, but it was overall pretty enjoyable), Good Score (really helped fit and set the tone for the movie), Good Cinematography (helped in setting the distinctive editing sequences, though the filter made it a bit hard to see the film), Pretty Good Sound, Great Editing (was a bit amateur at first but really helped in showing why the fast-cutting/hip-hop montage were a main-stay in the early 00s), Plot Structure was unique as it was different parallel story-lines converging at different points in the story with each having their own plot structure, Pacing was incredibly fast so it was a bit hard to keep up (though this was the point of the movie so it is fine with me), Build to climax was there; climax was definitely a memorable part of the movie given how it twists at what it was building at, Tone was very distinct in what it was trying to do but was a bit inconsistent in being set as it felt like it was trying too hard to play at both ends of the crime-comedy genre, the movie started off not that good but over-time it got better and better so it is definitely a slow burn that gets better the more the movie goes on. Overall, a fun watch with a pretty well written story and iconic editing sequences but is pretty simplistic in terms of its execution.
Shaun of the Dead -2 
Very Good Direction (Was able to help progress the movie forward in a very distinct style that is satire of the Zombie genre, also is able to use different editing techniques to make the movie very 00s), Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Simon Pegg (Played the titular character very well and is able to have other characters bounce off of him to help build jokes; also is able to show different ranges of emotion pretty well), Good from Nick Frost (Plays the comic relief character pretty well), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Very Good Story (A nice satire of the zombie genre but is a bit too safe at times (especially the end)), Very Good Screenplay (the different movements and dialogue help move the satire forward and makes it for a very overall funny movie (though it is pretty simplistic in what it is)), Pretty Good Score, Good Cinematography (Helps with the different fast-cuts and the side-panning helps it mock the zombie genre with the staple shot), Good Sound, Great Editing (a very polished rendition that helped in showing why the fast-cutting/hip-hop montage were a main-stay in the early 00s), Pretty Bad Visual Effects (Felt very low budget and not well done), Pretty Bad Makeup (Felt pretty amateur and low budget when trying to convey the zombies), Plot Structure was pretty simplistic and formulaic (though there really was not anything to add or cut), Pacing was consistent and steady, Build to climax was there and a pivotal part in how the character dealt with the apocalypse; climax was fine but felt very safe and 00s in how it ended, Tone was very similar to that of satires as is very light-hearted while taking elements of the zombie genre. Overall, a very good satire that is a fun laugh as it pokes at the zombie genre in a very unique way, though it can be very simplistic and safe at times.
Horrible Bosses 2 
Decent Direction (Comedic elements were decently executed and it was pretty similar in feel to that of comedies from that timeframe), Good Acting (The whole ensemble cast was very experienced and each played to their strengths very well (like Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and Charlie Day (Who was just playing Charlie Kelly from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia))), Pretty Bad Story (The actual concept of the movie as pretty interesting, it is just the plot itself was very simplistic, predictable, and unrealistic to how it favored the heros to win), Decent Screenplay (A movie with funny/enjoyable moments but is overall very simplistic and has bland dialogue), Plot Structure was too predictable and simple, Pacing was good as it kept a consistent pace for the most part (Nothing to really add or cut), Build to climax was very typical of movies from this time; climax was very dumb in how it tried to make the heros win (something that is very typical of movies from this era), Tone was very similar to other comedies from the time. Overall, an enjoyable movie with funny performances from the experienced cast, but is overall very simple and bland in terms of writing.
Marcel the Shell with Shoes On -5 
Good Direction (Really immerses himself in the film as a key person and does so in a way that really helps move the story forward), Good Acting (Very Good from Jenny Slate (Is able to capture the cute and charm of the character as she brings him to life in a way that makes you really care for him), Pretty Good from Dean Fleischer Camp (Able to interject himself well throughout the movie and work with something that really is not there (at least during filming)), Good from Isabella Rossellini (Able to be that elderly figure for Marcel and does that well for the movie), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (Very simple in the finding home trope and tries to play well to the cute nature of Marcel), Good to Very Good Screenplay (The actual dialogue was pretty simple (even though it was a lot of improv) but it does try to deal with issues of family, community, and loneliness and does a good job at doing so), Good Cinematography (Has a very low-budget, documentary style feel to it), Very Good Editing (did a lot with the low budget it had and how it had to mix live-action with stop-motion animation), Good Visual Effects (Did a good job in helping capture that stock-motion feel with its mix of animation/stop-motion), Plot Structure was very simplistic but followed very nicely (so no complaints), Pacing was good (even for the short runtime), Build to climax was good; climax was good (and the ending resolution was enough time to help close of the movie), Tone was very consistent with that of other children's movies but with a low-budget/indie twist. Overall, a very cute movie that is very simple on the surface but has a little bit more depth for a children's movie (especially for how low-budget it looked).
Nope 8 
Good to Very Good Direction (Really helped in creating the feel throughout the entire movie as he did a good job in helping establish scenes), Good to Very Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Daniel Kaluuya (Really is able to be the grounded character for all characters to build off of and does a good job in mixing serious and comedic moments), Good from Keke Palmer (Basically just plays herself), Good to Very Good from Steven Yeun (Shows his experience and has a bit more depth in showing how past traumas have effected his character as well as shows some animation), Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Bad Story (The actual plot construction was fine with the different details coming together to help lead the film to the climax, but the actual conflict is poorly constructed as it is just presented with no real introduction or conclusion towards the end (an issue I have had with all of Jordan Peele's movies); also there is a bit of some plot holes in the ending that make it a bit hard to realize how it was pulled off by the characters), Good Screenplay (Well written dialogue that has good mixes of comedy and horror (with the horror elements being a bit cliche), and the use of foreshadowing was typical to that of other horror movies), Good Score (Really helped in complementing the scarier moments to give it that horror feel), Very Good to Great Cinematography (Has more of the big-budget movie feel as the switching of wide-screen to full-screen is similar to that of Christopher Nolan movies (which makes sense given its the same DP)), Good to Very Good Sound (Typical to that of other horror movies), Good to Very Good Editing (Helped in building the suspense), Decent Visual Effects (Was fine but felt a bit underdeveloped given the production budget of the movie), Plot Structure was fine and typical to that of other horror films, Pacing was fine for the most part, Build to climax was a bit short but a noticeable and memorable part of the movie given the events that happened previous to it; climax was very well executed and definitely the most captivating part of the movie, Tone was an overarching horror but the different elements of comedy definitely gave it a good feel at times, Peele has gone for a more traditional horror feel with this movie and I liked this as it was a bit more focused and the added elements of comedy helped play to his strengths; the Chimp scene was definitely one of the scariest scenes I have ever scene in a movie given the sense of realism and what went on during it (definitely is one of the most well executed scenes I have ever scene in a movie). Overall, a more traditional horror movie for Jordan Peele that has a good mix of horror and comedic in a big-budget project that make it a good watch, but the actual conflict of the movie is really lacking to where it really holds the film back from being something special.
Blue Bayou 1 
Decent to Pretty Good Direction (The actual artistic shots were very well executed and the ability to capture emotions was very nice, but the acting at many moments is really hard to watch at how bad it is), Acting on a spectrum (Great from Justin Chon (The only multi-dimensional performance in the whole movie as he really puts everything he has in playing this character as his struggle is the major driving element of the film), Pretty Good from Alicia Vikander (Able to hold her own throughout the movie but is really underwhelming at many points given she is an Oscar winning actress (especially in the angry and emotional scenes of the movie)), Pretty Good from Linh Dan Pham (Was able to hold her own in the movie and play a key character in helping show symbolism), Pretty Good from Sydney Kowalske, Very Bad from the rest of the cast (where at some points is it is very hard to watch at how bad they are)), Pretty Good Story (The actual plot overarching construction is good with many elements I did like, but there are many useless moments in the film just meant to fill time), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The symbolism of the film is very prevalent and shown very well and there are many scenes where the dialogue is good (especially Justin Chon's dialogue), but there are many moments in the film where the dialogue is very unrealistic and just feels very forced), Score was present, Good to Very Good Cinematography (It really shines in the Bayou scenes and especially when its at night with the lighting), Decent Sound, Good to Very Good Editing (The actual construction of scenes was very well put together from a macro sense), Plot Structure was fine in the overarching sense but there were many elements in the movie that could have been cut to give the movie a more cleaner watch (like 10-15 minutes worth), Pacing was a bit on the slower side, Build to climax was good and one of the more emotional parts of the movie as you really do care for Justin Chon's character; climax was the most heartbreaking part of the movie as it is the most emotional moment, Tone was a bit too much on the feel-good side as it resembles that of a Lifetime movie at times. Overall, a movie that is carried solely by Justin Chon with a performance that makes the audience engaged with the film and his struggle (with some good elements of direction as well), but the movie heavily dragged back by the other characters and their scenes as it is really hard to watch at times.

Very Good to Great Direction (Did a really good job in helping choreograph the different fight scenes, fast cuts in helping drive the narrative, and getting the most out of their actors in many different parts in the film; sometimes they do get lost is in their own pace as they cannot keep up with the fast pace they have created and did not do the best in helping bring the whole thing home), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Michelle Yeoh (Really is able to command the film and show multiple dimensions in her performance as she helps the character grown from her insecurities to a confident lead in the end), Pretty Good to Good from Stephanie Hsu (Is fine in helping portray a multiple sided character that is a angsty teen with villain capabilities, but her performance can get really annoying at times as she plays too strong into the Villain and teen tropes to where her performance becomes a bit limited and annoying), Very Good from Ke Huy Quan (really steals the show sometimes as he still has that charm that Short Round had while still moving a bit past to show his ability to show multiple dimensions as an actor), Good from James Hong (Plays the typical character that he usually plays but does a good job in doing it), Good to Very Good from Jamie Lee Curtis (Shows her experience in the role and is able to be a monotonous anti-hero very well), Good from the rest of the cast), Very Good Story (Very good concept and does a good job in explaining the concept, the storytelling of the film is also very good as the audience is very captivated by what is happening and what will happen next; there are some issues with overall plot construction and how everything is distributed), Great Screenplay (Very witty and the jokes are very good, there is also a lot of symbolism present in multiple ways (even absurd ones)), Decent Score, Great Cinematography (really comes to light in the fighting scenes), Very Good Sound, Incredible Editing (Is used in a very good way in helping tell the story and show the different worlds the characters are going through in parallel), Decent Visual Effects (Is fine given the budget but can really show sometimes in how cheap it is), Good Makeup, Good Costumes (Helps in differentiating the different worlds), Plot Structure is the movie is a big issue as it is split into three parts but puts way too much into the first than the final two (especially the last one) as the final two parts feel a bit rushed (to where 10-20 minutes from the first part could be cut out and the exact same movie would be there), Pacing was incredibly fast to where many details can be lost if not paying attention (due to how content dense the movie is), Build to climax is very well done and a good epiphany for the main character as she learns her importance; climax was very underwhelming as it tries a bit too hard to be feel good to where it just feels incredibly forced and unrealistic, Tone of the movie is a bit unique as it blends multiple genres (whether it be martial arts, comedy, absurd comedy, and even drama), One of the better movies to tackle the multiverse as it is clear in how it explains it (though is still fast and dense). Overall, a great movie that is very unique in how it blends many genres that is driven by its performances, writing, and action, but it does falter a bit from an inconsistent plot structure, fast pacing, and ending that is very feel good.
Eyes Wide Shut -4 
Good Direction (It was definitely Kubrick in style but the direction of people other than the leads (and even the leads) was a bit underwhelming at times), Decent Acting (Good from Tom Cruise (Plays a very Tom Cruise character throughout the movie but does shine in different parts), Decent from Nicole Kidman (A very hit or miss performance from her as there are some moments where she is really good and some moments where she gives questionable deliveries), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Good to Very Good Story (The story and story-telling of the first two acts is very captivating and very interesting but the final act really falls apart in terms of a climax (which really comes in the middle but there is a definite climax in the end) and resolution), Decent Screenplay (The foreshadowing and symbolism of the movie is very good and pretty standard to Kubrick's style, but the dialogue is really simplistic and pretty bad at times), Very Good Score/Soundtrack (Really did a good job in helping music paint the scenes/mood of the movie and the record-player stopping the music was a nice touch), Very Good Cinematography (Extremely Kubrick with cinematography (long panning to show rooms and sharp shot reverse shots) but needs to be as it helps paint the scenes (especially in the party)), Good to Very Good Sound (as seen with the record player note), Good Editing (Very Kubrick in style with its fades), Very Good Costumes (Helps with giving the lavish, mysterious feels of the party), Plot Structure was in thirds with the first two acts being good in exposition and rising action but the last act really is not structured well as it is a bit rushed and does not come to any resolution in the end, Pacing was more on the slower side (typical of Kubrick) with 20 minutes that could have either have been put into the end or just removed to make it a tighter runtime, Build to climax was pretty anticlimactic with the real climax happening in the middle of the movie; climax was very bland and boring as the real climax being in the middle (kinda blew because it was neither closed up or left open to interpretation. It was this weird middle ground and the actual ending was pretty anticlimactic), Tone was very kubrick in style but had some shades of mystery that kept the viewers interested, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman might not have been the best cast for this movie as even though they are married they do not really show that much chemistry. Overall, an interesting watch as the audience gets to see Kubrick give off his sendoff (with many elements that are synonymous to his style) in a story that captivating for the most part, but does not deliver to the level he is known for with not so great writing and final act that really falls apart towards the end.
Bullet Train 19 
Decent Direction (The choreography of the action scenes was well done but the overall moving of the story forward with the very sharp cuts to try to create humor were not that well executed (with the actors also not really given that much to work with)), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Good from Brad Pitt (Really has to pull from his experience in the role as he isn't given that much from the director or script to work with, but he still does do a fine job (mainly because he is playing someone who is close to his real life persona)), Pretty Bad from Joey King (It is understandable that her character was portrayed to be annoying, but she really was not that good in the role), Good to Very Good from Aaron Taylor-Johnson (A joint performance with Brian Tyree Henry as they both really do a good job at playing off each other to build comedy and action), Good to Very Good from Brian Tyree Henry (See Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (but there was a real issue of screen-time with a huge cast like this)), Pretty Bad Story (The actual concept and idea was decent but the overall story was very poorly laid out to the point that the ending becomes very tiring), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was filled with way too much meta humor in that it tries so hard to be like Deadpool but just ends up being very annoying (though some jokes and moments were funny (like the cameos))), Decent Score, Good Cinematography (Especially during the fight scenes), Good Sound, Good Editing, Good Visual Effects, Plot Structure was very poorly laid out as it has a big issue in building things up as if they are important then bringing them down in minutes (with this happening so many times that it just gets boring towards the end), Pacing was very fast but could have still cut out some time (like 20 mins) because of how dense in content it is, Build to climax was there but not that exciting cause it was the standard preparing for a battle trope; climax was well done and a good fighting scene, Tone was way too much like Deadpool to the point where it is very annoying, The 75% of the movie's action scenes and best moments were shown in the trailer to the point where everything else that is shown is just boring or redundant. Overall, a movie that is entertaining for the action elements and some comedic moments, but is not a good movie in terms of writing, story structure, and overall feel.
The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent -80 
Decent to Pretty Good Direction (Directs the movie as if it is a early 2010s comedy (which kinda is a big drawback given its almost a decade later, but does a good job in moving the story forward and getting a good amount out of his characters)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Nicolas Cage (He is basically playing himself in an exaggerated way so there really is not that much room for error), Good from Pedro Pascal (Does a good job in building off of Cage as someone who admires the actor's work (While also showing his ability to act as well)), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (It is a fun concept that can only go so far but the movie does a good job in being entertaining for what it is (Though it is filled with many cliches to make it very feel-good and the style the movie is trying to emulate)), Pretty Good Screenplay (Overall simplistic screenplay with good funny moments that make the movie entertaining), Score was very typical of 2010s movies in how it is used, Pretty Good Cinematography (was a fan of the filter they used throughout the movie), Decent Sound (Similar to that of other action comedies), Decent Editing, Decent Visual Effects, Plot Structure was nicely laid out and very safe in that it is similar to other action comedies, Pacing was a bit on the faster side at some points but is overall pretty nice (no need to add or cut any material), Build to climax was very cliche and very similar to that of action comedy movies of the 2010s; climax was entertaining in how a action comedy can be, Tone was way too much like that of a early 2010s action comedy movies (which is kinda troubling given that this movie comes out after a decade later). Overall, an entertaining movie that has some funny moments and noticeable acting (especially with Nic Cage), but reeks too much like a early 2010s comedy to the point where it feels very dated in its style (that is this movie would be a lot better if it came out 10 years earlier).
John Wick -10 
Pretty Bad Direction (The choreography of action sequences was very well done (Some of the best I have seen), but the moving of the story forward and the direction of actors was bad considering how dull the movie really was), Bad Acting (Pretty Good from Keanu Reeves (Able to handle the action sequences in a great way and is a strong prominent figure throughout the movie (With some good moments in dramatic acting), but has some really questionable scenes that may be in fault from the direction he was given), Acting on a Spectrum from the rest of the cast (Anywhere from very bad and emotionless (like Alfie Allen) to decent acting (like Willem Dafoe))), Good Story (Though it is filled with cliches of an ex-conman coming back into the fold, the storytelling and character writing of John Wick is very good to paint him as the ultimate figure to not be messed with), Pretty Bad to Decent Screenplay (The dialogue was very bland but there were some good moments), Score was just present (but did help in the action scenes when present), Good Cinematography, Good to Very Good Sound, Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Especially, when showing the firefights), Good Costumes (Even though it is just a suit, they really helped create an iconic character in John Wick), Plot Structure was decent for the most part (but does follow a typical action-movie one), Pacing was incredible fast to where the runtime was very short (But this helps in giving pace to the character of John Wick), Build to climax was prevalent and noticeable in its prep for the action; climax was well executed and a fun part of the movie, Tone of the movie was very dark and grungy (adds to that John Wick feel); but there is a lot of dryness from the deadpan that it kinda takes away from this, The action scenes of the movie were some of the best choreographed action scenes I have ever seen as it is just so physical and technical that it keeps the audience engaged and wanting more. Overall, a movie that is not so great in its own right with its lackluster direction, acting, and screenplay, but is an enjoyable watch because of its intense action scenes and character writing of John Wick (painting a character that will be fun to see what happens next to him).
Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi -42 
Good Direction (He is able to move the story forward in the typical Star Wars way, but is a step behind from the first two movies (given how much he is able to get out of the actors and the general off feel there is at points in the movie)), Good Acting (Pretty Good from the Live-Action cast; Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Good from Mark Hamill (A real step back in this performance as he is more reserved and over-the-top (which makes sense given he is now a Jedi), and really is not able to capture the same charm he had in the first two films (even when it is warranted)), Very Good from Harrison Ford (The only one of the main cast who does not have that far back of a drop-off in his performance as he really has to play to his instincts/experience from the character to give this performance (which shows some drop off but is nonetheless the charismatic star of the show)), Decent from Carrie Fisher (Really took a step back in her performance as she reverts to someone who is not able to keep up with the cast (with the lack of inflection and big pauses in delivery)), Pretty Good from Billy Dee Williams (not as much of a presence in this film as he lost the charm that made his character so lovable from the previous film, though still does have some good moments), Pretty Good to Good from Ian McDiarmid (Though limited, he did show why he was the right choice for the emperor), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (Really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (Created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship; and continues to show how loving he is towards his new friends), Great from Frank Oz (Really brought the character of Yoda to life with puppeteering and the vocal performance, though he really does not have that much to work with this time), Very Good from Warwick Davis (also for other Ewoks, a debut role that really helped play to the adorableness of the Ewoks), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast; Very Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (Even though the film switches back to its more linearly story-telling style, the overarching story does do a good job at bringing the trilogy to a close), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue takes a step back from its improvements in the last film as it is very obvious at times where George Lucas wrote the dialogue as it is very unnatural; The overall structure of foreshadowing and symbols is worthy of Star Wars praise (Still with some iconic lines)), Brilliant Score (Continues to take what was great from the previous film and adds some new themes that really make this score stand out as well), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Which really stands out in the Luke vs. Vader scene), Great Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life), Very Good to Great Editing, Pretty Bad to Decent Visual Effects (While there are some monumental moments, there is a wide use of bad Green Screen (which was easy to see) and an excessive use of pyrotechnics (to where it just got annoying); there are also many flaws from the new edition that were so painful to watch (example being the Jabba's palace scenes)), Incredible to Brilliant Production Design (Some of the best sets in all of Star Wars that are so iconic and well remembered in history, with the Tatooine/Endor sets being some of my favorite from the series), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context; also, the ewok costumes were so adorable in how they were designed to where it added to us caring about them), Plot Structure went back to the linear structure but does a good job in setting pieces together and making sure everything comes together in the end, Pacing was good and not too rushed or slow, Build to climax was good as it helped build the relationships between the different characters (Luke and Vader as well as Han and Leia); Climax was a bit anticlimactic (as even though they went for luke to be the better man, it just did not have the flare that the previous movies had as it was meant more for closure in the characters rather than entertainment), Tone goes back to being a mix of a space opera/science fiction epic as the movie really acts as the final act in the saga (needing the other two movie's support to keep it going), As a movie meant to close out the saga it does a good job in bringing closure to character arcs and stories (but this movie cannot really be a stand alone film). Overall, a step back from the previous Star Wars films by reverting back similar bad habits (with George Lucas's poor dialogue and over use of effects), but the movie does do a good job in ending the saga with its world-building and great storytelling (something that makes the Original Trilogy one of the most respected in movie history).
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial -3 
Incredible Direction (Spielberg does an amazing job in helping movie the story forward and helping build emotion and a connections with ET and the younger characters in the film; also, his ability to conduct very grandiose scenes is something that is definitely applauded), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good to Good from Dee Wallace (Plays the typical 80s mom character and is written as such), Good from Henry Thomas (Was able to hold his own as a child actor as the conduit between ET and the human world), Pretty Good to Good from Robert MacNaughton (Plays the older brother/bully character well and acts as a strong elder figure as he plays off Thomas well towards the climax), Good from Drew Barrymore (plays the innocent, youthful character very well and shows glimpses of what made her a big star in the coming years), Decent from the rest of the cast (typical 80s supporting cast)), Great to Incredible Story (The architecture of the story is laid out very nicely with the different elements helping make it iconic and a pioneering effort in the science-fiction genre), Very Good Screenplay (Filled with iconic lines that are coupled with foreshadowing and symbolism to help drive the story forward; also the homages to Star Wars were a funny touch), Incredible Score (Iconic overall and used very well in the film, especially how it blends in to create the mood of the scenes), Brilliant Cinematography (Especially with the angles and how they used light to emphasis the dark (blinding the face as well (which was a very nice touch in not showing the bad guys and painting them as elder figures the children should not trust)); also, the use of fog in the light helped create more of an ominous feeling), Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Groundbreaking for the time (especially the puppetry and use of flying), but did not age as well as other films from the time as the Green Screen is pretty obvious to see), Plot Structure was laid out very nicely as each arc in the story did not feel like it was overstaying its place in the film (with all the elements building off of each other to help move the story forward), Pacing was consistent throughout the movie (with it not being too fast or too slow), Build to climax was very evident and played out very well (with the characters planning on how they will let ET out); climax was executed very nicely and one of the most iconic moments in cinema history, Tone was more on the feel-good family movie side that has science fiction subject matter (and does a good job in helping develop this tone throughout the movie), Design of ET was very iconic (even though it is very 80s) with the puppetry of the character being a very important part in creating how adorable and caring he was; the end of the movie really dragged out but was still incredibly emotional and iconic in how the movie closes the chapters on its characters. Overall, an iconic family movie that captures the hearts of its audiences through its titular character and the character's plight of trying to make his way back home, taking the audience on an emotional adventure that is guided with Spielberg's incredible direction, groundbreaking cinematography, and iconic John Williams Score.
Beast 6 
Bad Direction (The whole movie felt like a chaotic mess with the acting, screenplay, sound, and editing all not matching), Very Bad to Bad Acting (Pretty Bad to Decent from Idris Elba (Even though he is not given that much to work with, he still isn't able to use his experience to make this performance believable as he is not able to hit the dramatic moments and connect with the other characters), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (The girls were just incredibly annoying throughout the movie (and making dumb-decisions along with that), and the friend really was limited in his range during the suspenseful moments)), Bad Story (The actual idea of the story was pretty dumb and simplistic (with the introduction of the conflict being executed pretty poorly)), Bad Screenplay (The dialogue of the movie felt very unnatural and the humor moments were incredibly forced and not funny; the symbolism was also very dumb and not that important for the movie (even with its impact on the ending)), Pretty Good Score (Probably one of the better parts of the movie but was poorly mixed into the movie), Good Cinematography (Some of the dolly and tracking shots were well done, with the wild-life cinematography also well shot), Very Bad Sound (Was so poorly mixed into the movie (especially the score) that it was so hard to hear what was going on and focus on the actual conflict; the editing was not that bad but the mixing was so bad that it makes the movie very hard to watch), Decent Editing, Very Bad Visual Effects (The lions of the movie looked so fake that it was more laughable than terrifying when the thriller/suspenseful parts come on), Pretty Good Production Design (The sets they used were very good and helped show the wildlife of Africa, its just there were barely any sets used), Plot Structure was very poorly laid out as the movie was way too short to have a well executed conflict build (with the actual conflict not being that scary to begin with; Exposition is pretty unorganized with the sound mixing being bad as the score is louder than the dialogue (which is already not that great; The rising of the conflict is really badly executed as it's so chaotic and unorganized with the action coupled with the poor performance of scared emotions being portrayed)), Pacing was incredibly fast (which is mainly because of the short runtime (though I do not want to see any more of the movie to justify it being longer)), Build to climax was typical to that of any monster/survival movie; climax was so anticlimactic and honestly very laughable given how absurd it is (with it overall being very boring and typical to that of other generic monster movie climaxes), Tone was supposed to be scary and that of a thriller but the movie is just so poorly executed that its just hard to be attached to the movie to care. Overall, a very poorly executed movie with almost everything across the board not hitting as Idris Elba cannot save this mess from being watchable, with the poor direction, acting, writing, and sound mixing making the movie more laughable than scary.
Boogie Nights -31 
Very Good Direction (While he does falter in some of the micro scenes and getting the most out of his actors, he does some very unique things in capturing scenes from a macro level that shows why he caught the eye of many when this movie came out (like the parallelism and ability to set scenes)), Good Acting (Pretty Good from Mark Wahlberg (There are many moments in the film where he shows his limit (like in screaming matches), but he does show some talent when it comes to playing the very anxious character (something that characters later in his career tend not to be)), Good to Very Good from Julianne Moore (Her performance starts out very rough in the beginning but gets better as the movie goes on to show how lost of a character she becomes (especially in the custody scenes)), Very Good to Great from Burt Reynolds (Really commands every scene he is in and shows his experience in being the fatherly figure in the movie), Pretty Good to Good Don Cheadle (Shows some depth in his performance but is not really given that much time to work with to make this a meanwhile performance), Decent to Pretty Good from John C. Reilly (Actually plays a surprisingly funny comedic relief character at times in how he tries to size-up Dirk to hide his insecurities), Good to Very Good from William H. Macy (His performance was very funny as his function in the movie was really to be a comedic relief character that shows how far the adult entertainment industry can lead a person (to where there is no real out)), Pretty Good from Heather Graham, Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (While the movie is very entertaining and there are elements of the movie that are very important to the movie, there are many moments in the film that are just fluff to the point where they provide nothing to the story (especially the climax); though, the overall structure of the rise and fall of the characters was well done), Good Screenplay (There is a lot of parallelism throughout the movie which I really enjoyed but the dialogue was just very basic, unnatural, and hard to watch), Good Score (helps with giving off that 70s-80s vibe), Great Cinematography (Really helped with establishing the scenes with the tracking shots that followed the characters around the space), Decent to Pretty Good Sound, Great Film Editing, Plot Structure on a macro scale was very good but it spend way too much time on the exposition to where the downfall was rushed and did not have that much content (along with having a useless climax), Pacing was good (not too slow and not too fast (though the downfall was a bit rushed), the runtime of the movie was way longer than it needed to be (like 20-30 minutes of the movie could have been cut out and it would have been the same movie)), Build to the climax was great and executed very nicely as it really helped portray the downfall of the characters; climax was actually irrelevant (if you cut it all out the same outcome would come (But the resolution was good in helping tie up all the lose ends)), Tone of the movie was well established and one of the highlights of the film as PTA did a great job in building up the glamour of the 70s and then shifting it to the downfall of the 80s very well. Overall, a Pretty Good movie that does a good job in helping establishing the scenes and vibe of the subject matter coupled with an interesting story, but is held back from issues in plot construction, some of the performances and writing, and an irrelevant climax (with other scenes being irrelevant as well).
Pan's Labyrinth 24 
Very Good Direction (Does a good job in helping move the story forward and helping set some of the fantasy-esque scenes), Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Sergi López (really does a good job in helping portray the true monster of the film as he does a good job in helping create a sense of conflict in a menacing fashion for all the characters), Good from Maribel Verdú (Does a really good job in helping act as the conduit between the evil and the innocent as she has to hide her true identity in helping fight for what she believes in), Good from Ivana Baquero (Does a good job in helping be the focal point of the film and acts as the innocence that tries to save the broken world), Good from Doug Jones (Does a good job in helping bring the Faun to live as the character is someone who is scary and menacing on the surface, but is someone who is very loving and caring on the inside), Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (The movie was told as if it was a fairytale (which I really liked), but there were definitely elements of the film that could have been more concise/cut out; the mix between the tasks and the revolution really showed the innocence during a troubling time; the plot was incredibly safe and very predictable), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue was incredibly simplistic (I haven't spoken Spanish in over 4 years and I could understand most of the movie) and the elements of symbolism were pretty surface level (like painting the true monster of the movie being the Captain through his dialogue "Do you think I am a monster" and the importance of the watch to show his selfish, narcissistic nature)), Decent Score, Good to Very Good Cinematography (Really helped with building the scenes and presenting a fairytale), Good Sound, Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (A little dated but is still very good for the time), Good Production Design, Very Good Makeup, Plot Structure was good for the most part and everything is laid out very nicely, Pacing was good (not too fast or slow), Build to climax was very good but seems a bit forced on the fairytale side; climax was good and feels very similar to The Shinning (though the ending was so basic and safe that it really deterred from the story), Tone felt very similar to that of a fairy-tale or fantasy through its storytelling and use of CGI (and does a really good job in using these elements to set the tone), The message of the movie felt very obvious as it was meant to show the captain was the real monster and not the actual monsters (though it is a safe message). Overall, a Pretty Good movie that does a really good job at painting a fairy-tale during the Franco Spanish reign as it paints who the real monsters were, but is a very safe movie that has pretty overt symbols and simple writing.
Jerry Maguire -34 
Decent Direction (Keeps the movie entertaining, but the overall execution is very bland and similar to other Rom-Coms from the 90s), Decent Acting (Very Good from Tom Cruise (Really carries the movie and is the focal point for other actors to play off of, but he is just playing himself and it really shows), Very Good from Cuba Gooding Jr. (Really helps play off of Cruise and match his level of animation as the chemistry they build together helps keep the story going), Pretty Bad from Renée Zellweger (Does not have any chemistry with Cruise and her scenes are sometimes hard to watch as the delivery sometimes comes off as cringy), Good from Regina King (Does her job really well and does a good job in playing off the other actors to help keep her scenes interesting), Good from Jonathan Lipnicki (Does a good job in being the adorable character that helps give Cruise a moral compass to keep coming back to the family), Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (The overarching story was entertaining but it is an incredibly safe movie that is very predictable; the storytelling was also very amateur as it does so much telling what is going on rather than showing), Decent Screenplay (Very simplistic dialogue (even though it has very memorable lines) that has very surface-level meaning with all the messages being outright explained in the movie; also, the movie suffers from complete narcissism in how much they mention Jerry Maguire's name (which could be a symbol of how highly the character thinks of himself and his notoriety but it comes off as more annoying than symbolic)), Decent Score, Decent Cinematography, Bad Sound (Nothing seems fluid and it is obvious where the editing and mixing is), Pretty Bad Editing (Everything is very sharp with little transitions between the cuts), Plot Structure was good for the most part as it follows as very simplistic Rom-Com structure, Pacing was good (not too slow or fast), Build to climax was very typical of Rom-Coms and was very easy to tell what was going to happen; climax was entertaining but very predictable (both for the sports side and the romantic side), Tone was very 90s Rom-Com that has elements of sports in the background. Overall, an entertaining movie that has memorable performances by Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr., but is filled with many cliches of 90s comedies as it is very formulaic and predictable with its decent direction and predictable storyline.
Don't Worry Darling -1 
Bad Direction (Olivia Wilde does a poor job in getting the most out of her actors as well as building the story/suspense as there are many questionable and poorly executed scenes that really take away from me being interested in what is going on), Bad Acting (Good from Florence Pugh (For the the most part of the movie, Pugh does a good job in portraying the protagonist and helping show how she is an outsider trying to find the truth (but there are still some questionable moments/scenes that hold her back from giving a memorable performance)), Bad from Harry Styles (His switches in accent really get annoying throughout the movie and there are many moments where he cannot act to the level of suspense/intensity of the movie (with the climax being a good example)), Bad from Olivia Wilde (With her being the director (and doing a poor job at it), she really plays an overall bland character that is overall forgettable and not up to the standard she is trying to portray the movie as), Decent from Gemma Chan (Her scenes are pretty memorable and she does a decent job in holding her own throughout the movie), Pretty Good from Chris Pine (Really starts off slow as he plays a character he is not really accustomed to playing, but as the film progresses he starts become more believable as the creator of the world that has so many questions), Bad from the rest of the cast (the overall cast tries to play a 1950s type of cast but it really does not hit the mark and comes off as very tacky rather than representative of the time)), Pretty Bad Story (The overarching idea of the story is pretty interesting and kinda cool, but the storytelling mixed with many plot holes and useless plot elements really takes away from this story being memorable as it comes off as more of a clone to the Truman Show/Matrix than being unique in itself), Bad Screenplay (With the tone and acting trying to mimic the 1950s, the vernacular is very modern and creates a weird juxtaposition; the actual dialogue was very bland and choppy (with nothing flowing); they do have some symbolism (like the inclusion of the Sylvia Plath book to show how she is losing her mind) but the movie is just too boring and uninteresting to care about any of the symbols they put at us), Decent Score, Very Good Cinematography (Able to use lighting and different camera angles to help build symbolism, especially with the use of the sun blinding the camera), Great Editing (The automation of routine and the hip-hop montages were used well to show how simulated the world they were living in is), Pretty Good Visual Effects, Great Production Design (Really enjoyed the 50s sets they used to mimic this utopian world they tried to create), Good Costumes, Plot Structure was not that well set up as the exposition is not that well set up and the conflict being introduced was not that good, Pacing felt super slow cause of how long the movie was (by the final third of the movie I was just bored from how long of a movie it was), Build to the climax was very poorly executed (but it was a decent idea they were trying to go with); climax was pretty typical and predictable, Tone followed this mix of the 50s with a thriller and was not well established because of how the other movie parts were not executed well. Overall, a movie that was not executed well and really misses the mark in what it tries to show as it fails from poor direction and writing that make the movie more boring than thrilling.

Very Bad Direction (While there are some moments that I did like, there are incredibly way more moments that I absolutely hated about this movie because the overall storytelling and direction of actors is some of the worst I have ever seen as these flaws coupled with awkward dead space to make the movie seem more artsy makes the whole movie just terrible), Very Bad to Bad Acting (Decent from Ana de Armas (She does do well in a handful of instances (like the monologue by the bathtub) and gets the mannerisms of Monroe down very easily, the issue is that there are way too many misses in the performance (which I blame more on the direction and writing) and you can still hear her Cuban accent), Pretty Bad to Decent from Adrien Brody (While the performance isn't that bad, it is just not that memorable as it is very bland and dull), Pretty Bad to Decent from Bobby Cannavale (Another performance that just isn't that special and just lacks chemistry when trying to play off  De Armas (Even though that may be the point)), Very Bad from Julianne Nicholson (Just really lacks any direction and is very hard to watch at how bad and off beat it is, she also cannot play off any actors at all as her dialogue with other actors just seems so forced for someone who is supposed to be mentally unstable), Terrible from the rest of the cast (It feels like many of the actors are just amateurs and have never acted before as the scenes with other actors (especially when they are talking about Monroe) are just so hard to watch)), Bad Story (The movie does a really bad job at choosing which events of Monroe's life to actually focus on as it is just awkward transitions and jumps into different parts of her life that it feels very unnatural; also, the movie is very predictable at times that it makes it very boring; many plot holes in the movie that just never get answered), Terrible Screenplay (One of the worst screenplays I have ever seen as it is just so unnatural, clunky, forced, and horribly written that it makes the movie very hard to watch; also the symbolism of the movie is just unimportant for how bad the actual dialogue is), Pretty Good to Good Score (The piano theme of the movie actually was good and I did like it spread throughout the movie), Terrible Cinematography (There were so many flaws and shots in this movie that made it so hard to watch (like the random black and white shots, the forced shot-reverse-shots, and the POV shots) that make the movie just feel so amateur; the movie theater shots were pretty good but considering how bad the other shots in the movie were it does not cover for it), Decent Sound, Pretty Bad to Decent Editing (There were some editing techniques I did like (like the transitions from one scene to another and her showing her routine slowly killing her), but overall it just feels so amateur and very bad (like the blurring of the faces (which is something you can edit on like Tik Tok))), Very Bad Visual Effects (Feels incredibly tacky and amateur and the CGI of the baby is actually horrible and hard to watch; a lot of the effects just feels like a fever dream), Production Design (), Pretty Bad Costumes (They reuse a lot of the iconic costumes a lot throughout the movie and the costumes were not that well designed overall (especially the iconic vent dress)), Plot Structure is very inconsistent as there are so many jumps throughout the movie that are not subtle at all (leaving so many questions about what is going on in the plot), Pacing is incredibly slow despite all the jumps that the movie goes through as it just drags and feels very boring (The movie focuses too much on very small scenes and details); the overall runtime should have been cut by and hour and the movie would probably be the same), Build to the climax was decent as it portrays her downfall and does a decent job at showing it (but the scenes with JFK were just very weird and hard to watch at how sexual they were); climax is just boring cause she's just crazy and seeing things and it's overall very artsy (And the ending itself is very poorly executed), Tone is a mix of biopic with an artsy surrealist lens that overall does not hit because the actual tone of the movie is just very boring to even care what is going on, The message of the movie is very clear throughout (it separates Norma from Marilyn as the former is her true self while the later is just an object created by Hollywood) and the movie actually does a decent job at showing this (even though it is very forced); there are just way too many grotesque scenes that movie just gets too hard to watch (like the abortion scene). Overall, a Terrible movie that has a message of showing how corrupted Monroe's life became with the external pressures around her from being able to be herself, but the fails across the board in so many aspects that watching the movie feels like a waste of time at how bad and boring it is that you really don't care about anything from this movie.
Barbarian -4 
Pretty Good Direction (Able to get the storytelling across very nicely as he builds the narrative driven by suspense; also able to get the most out of his actors and elicit fear (at least in the horror parts, the non-horror parts were pretty bland and amateur)), Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good to Good from Georgina Campbell (Was able to hold her own very well being the lead character as her fear and anxiety builds throughout the movie the farther into the house she goes), Pretty Good from Bill Skarsgård (Works off of Campbell very well and helps build some of the suspense himself with his mannerisms), Pretty Good from Justin Long (Plays the aging/fading actor very well as he pulls from his experience), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (While the overall concept and layout is pretty cliche and simplistic, the storytelling is good and a lot of the elements play well together to drive the story forward; the ending is a bit questionable though), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue in the non-horror parts was a bit bland/simplistic, but there were many symbols and elements of horror that were spread throughout the movie that makes it very suspenseful and capture the audience's attention), Pretty Good Score, Very Good Cinematography (The different angles used throughout the movie are very good in helping build suspense and helping build the world/house that is very eerie), Good Sound, Good Editing, Pretty Bad Visual Effects (Really shows how low budget the movie is as the visual effects really make the movie tacky and less scary), Pretty Bad Makeup (Really tacky and really takes away with the movie being realistic at how bad it is), Plot Structure was pretty well laid out as it introduces the conflict very well and then builds it back up right after a switch in scenery (with the climax and end being very well defined), Pacing was good (not too slow or fast and the runtime was about right), Build to climax was very typical of horror movies but does a decent job at building suspense and keeping the audience engaged; climax was good and suspenseful (but the ending is a bit questionable and really takes away from the movie being scary), Tone was typical to that of many suspenseful horror movies (and the movie does a good job at building this). Overall, a fun, suspenseful watch that builds story pretty well and does many elements of horror right as you go farther into the conflict, but is pretty bare-bones when it comes to filmmaking, acting, and writing.
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King 3 
Incredible Direction (Does an amazing job in getting the most out of his actors and helping drive the story to a conclusion with many different moving parts going on at once), Great Acting by the cast (No one performance stands out as everyone acts as a unit to progress the story forward), Great Story (The movie is incredibly dense in its story material as it builds off of the previous two movies to bring a conclusion to the three part epic; moreover, the parallelism of the of the different storylines help keeps the movie engaging as the audience gets to see how all the storylines converge to a conclusion), Great to Incredible Screenplay (Very similar in style to the first two movies; the dialogue is very tight and flows very well throughout the movie as it helps drive the story forward; the symbolism throughout the movie is also on par with the previous movies (like showing the effects greed can have on corrupting an individual); the humor and wit of the movie is really good this time as well), Great Score (Carries on from the previous films), Great Cinematography (Especially when trying to show how grand the sets and fights were), Great Sound, Great Editing, Pretty Bad Visual Effects (While the actual CGI was very good, the green screen was so obvious in many of the scenes that it was so hard to pay attention to what was going on and take things seriously), Great Production Design, Good to Very Good Makeup (It was great for the most part, but the transition makeup for Gollum was pretty bad), Very Good Costumes, Plot Structure feels like it is trying to conclude all of the storylines from the previous movies as it serves as the conclusion for this trilogy (and less of a separate film) even though there is somewhat of a plot structure, Pacing was fast (though slower from last time) as the movie still tries to be very story dense and fit as much as it can in the movie; the epilogue is incredible slow though and could definitely have been cut in half to keep the runtime shorter (overall the movie could have been cut 30 minutes and have had the same feel), Build to climax was very good as it was more of a build to end all three of the movies; climax was incredible as the helps tie the ends of the entire trilogy as it keeps the audience engaged with what is going on and how the story will end, Tone was stereotypical of the fantasy genre (as it is treated as such), The movie is incredibly story dense as it implies so much from the previous movies in order to understand what is going on (which is not a terrible thing) but it makes it less of a stand alone movie. Overall, a great conclusion to the trilogy as it helps tie loose ends and bring the story to a close in an epic fashion, but the movie is very story dense (that could have been a bit tighter) that needs to seen as a continuation of the previous films rather than being a stand-alone film.
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 4 
Pretty Good Direction (Able to take command of his actors and drive the story forward (that be in a very Marvel way)), Pretty Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Letitia Wright (Really shows a range of emotions throughout the movie and is able to get through some of the tough moments very well; she is able to command lead in this film and really play a character trying to go through the grieving process), Pretty Good from Lupita Nyong'o (Nothing spectacular but she does hold her own), Pretty Good from Danai Gurira, Pretty Good to Good from Winston Duke (Really shows his presence with his charisma, power and humor in all the scenes he is in), Decent from Dominique Thorne (A character kinda just thrown into the movie, but she does a decent job with what she was given), Decent to Pretty Good from Tenoch Huerta Mejía (Plays the role decently well and shows some range (it just isn't really his fault given he isn't given that much to work with)), Pretty Good from Martin Freeman (Continues where he left off from the previous film), Very Good from Angela Bassett (The best performance of the movie as she uses her experience very well to be a powerful and loving figure that tries to pick up the pieces of a fractured nation), Decent from the rest of the cast), Pretty Bad Story (The overall narrative follows the boilerplate Marvel formula, but the moments dealing with grief were surprising and pretty good overall (especially for a marvel movie); the conflict overall was very boring as the villains and their world were just not that interesting (and pretty similar to Avatar)), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (Dialogue was pretty average for a marvel movie; the humor is very hit or miss (but when it hits it is very clever); the foreshadowing and symbolism was pretty predictable for a marvel movie), Very Good Score/Pretty Bad to Decent Soundtrack (at least in comparison to the previous soundtrack cause it does not match on the same level), Decent to Pretty Bad Cinematography (For the most part it is pretty typical of other Marvel movies but there are moments when it gets very nauseating), Good Sound, Good Editing (There were some edits that were very good like the parallelism in the climax and when it shows the villains mom getting older, but some of the editing techniques were not that appealing (like the slow-motion editing)), Pretty Bad Visual Effects (Felt very tacky (especially with raising his body) and feels like how other Marvel movies are in recent times (which is not a good thing)), Good Production Design, Good Makeup, Pretty Bad to Decent Costumes (The overall Wakanda costumes were good, its just Shuri's fits when being a regular person were pretty bad), Plot Structure was very typical of marvel movies, Pacing was the same pacing of marvel movies, Build to climax was good and shows the transition of power in the movie; climax was very typical of Marvel movies; the ending was incredibly safe and very predictable, Tone did share the same aspects of other marvel movies but there were more depressing tones throughout the movie due to the major themes of dealing with grief and loss, this movie does venture away a bit from the typical marvel model through its tributes to Boseman (which was a nice touch that they never actually showed his face) and how the characters have to deal with his death (something they had to change the whole direction of the movie for). Overall, a marvel movie that is a bit different considering how it deals with loss and grief, but is still flawed with its uninteresting plot and boilerplate Marvel template.
The Banshees of Inisherin -1 
Very Good Direction (He really gets a lot out of his actors and commands scenes very well, but there are some issues in keeping the audience captivated with a pretty bland tone; he is able to make different moments more funny than it could be), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Colin Farrell (Really shows multiple layers to the character as he really hones in on the loneliness he feels from losing everything around him), Very Good to Great from Brendan Gleeson (Plays off of Farrell very well as he shows the side of an individual who wants to change their life but cannot and loses himself because of it), Very Good from Kerry Condon (Really acts as the focal point of morality throughout the movie as she tries to be the bridge in many conversations), Good from Barry Keoghan (Started off pretty bad but really molded into his character as the movie went on), Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (The story is very simplistic as it does not try too much to be very flashy and does not make any failures from trying), Great Screenplay (The dialogue is very witty (in a very irish way) and is the driving force to move the story forward; the parallelism, symbolism, and foreshadowing is also very good as it helps keep the audience engaged with what is going on), Pretty Good Score, Good to Very Good Cinematography (Especially when setting the scene and showing the scenery), Good Sound, Good Editing, Great Production Design (Really helps show the scenery and the seclusion away from mainland Ireland), Plot Structure was very nice as it was clear throughout the movie how the story was unfolding, Pacing was on the slower side but was not that much of an issue (there could have been a lot of moments that have been cut but there really would be no need cause the movie is really about the screenplay and not the story), Build to the climax was good and helps show how Farrell's character is really losing everything around him as he enters a period of inescapable loneliness; climax was executed very nicely and was one of the more memorable parts of the movie, Tone was very true to the black-comedy genre as it uses wit and humor in juxtaposition to the more depressing/lonely undertones. Overall, a movie that does not have that many bells and whistles (and therefore could have probably been better as a play) as it uses a very well written screenplay with experienced actors (that have great chemistry with the director) to make the movie a memorable and fun watch (as it helps blend comedic themes with more depressing, lonely ones).
Blade Runner 2049 4 
Pretty Good to Good Direction (Does a Great Job in storytelling/moving the story forward as he is able to build scenes/worlds and pieces them toghether with other story elements; the issues in the direction come with directors his actors as it has a similar style to the first film and because of it there is a lot of dull performances with dead air), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good to Good from Ryan Gosling (Uses a lot of his facial experiences to help sell the scenes and acts as a replicant very well (which kinda hurts him because he really is not given that much to work with in terms of showing range)), Decent from Harrison Ford (Shows more experience and emotion from the last time but the performance just shows that he put no prep into the role as it just feels like he showed up with very little interest), Good to Very Good from Ana de Armas (Really acts as the morality of the movie as she works well off of Gosling to help give humanity to his life despite being fake herself), Decent from the rest of the cast (just a lot of emotionless performances that don't really help or hurt the movie)), Good to Very Good Story (Really does a good job in differing from the previous movie as the plot this time around was more about K finding his own humanity rather than a Blade Runner trying to hunt down replicants; the movie also does share the same philosophical interpretations on what it means to be alive but it is less open ended than last time), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (The screenplay does improve as it flows more than the last movie (not by that much though) but the symbolism is not as good as the previous movie; the foreshadowing is still very on-par with the previous movie as it is very evident at what they are trying to build throughout the movie), Good to Very Good Score, Incredible to Brilliant Cinematography (Such a beautiful movie in how they try to set up these different worlds and how they use lighting to help set the ominous nature of the scenes), Great Sound, Great Editing, Incredible Visual Effects, Great Production Design, Very Good Costumes, Plot Structure was laid out very well as it was prevalent which part of the story the movie is in, Pacing was on the slower side (with 20-30 minutes that could have been cut to make the movie a bit tighter and faster), Build to climax was decent (but hard considering how slow the movie was progressing); climax was decent but not that interesting or entertaining, Tone had more of that sci-fi tone than the original movie was going for as the advancement in technology really helped with setting this, The movie really benefits from the advancements in technology as it is able to be more of a realistic sci-fi movie as opposed to the previous movie. Overall, a very technically sound movie that uses advancements in filmmaking and technology to help make a better movie that its predecessor, though it still falters a bit in terms of bland writing/acting that is still very slow in pace.
The Menu 8 
Decent Direction (Does a pretty good to good job at moving the story forward and creating tension throughout the movie, but does a pretty bad job in getting the most out of his actors and setting tone and the conflict), Pretty Bad Acting (Good from Ralph Fiennes (Does a good job in holding his own and being the central figure for creating the tension in his scenes, but he only ever stays in a very tense second gear as I would have liked to have seen him hit third gear and be angry (Something I know he can do given his prior experience)), Good from Anya Taylor-Joy (Holds her own very nicely throughout the movie as she isn't really given that much to work with, really shows her ability to be a good actress the way she commands lead throughout), Pretty Bad from Nicholas Hoult (The character itself is written to be a very annoying (so not all of the blame is entirely on him), but he still really does not do that much to help capture the character as all the scenes he is in feel very forced and cringy), Pretty Good to Good from Hong Chau (Does a nice job in being the servant of the madness and helps with setting the tone in some of the very tense moments), Bad to Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Filled with inexperienced/actors who have only done small roles so much of this inexperience shows throughout the movie)), Pretty Good Story (While there are ebbs and flows in regards to the plot construction, the overall story is somewhat interesting and takes a lot from the haunted island trope), Bad Screenplay (The actual dialogue is pretty bland overall (though there are some humorous moments) and the symbolism is incredibly surface level that it feels more pretentious than trying to display a message), Pretty Good Score (Used more to help build tension rather than being something that stands alone), Decent Cinematography (There were some moments where it felt very good (like when trying to show the meals)), Good to Very Good Sound (Really helped with building the tension), Good Editing (Was really highlighted when showing the different dishes), Plot Structure was a real mess as it does not do a good job in transitioning to different parts of the arch (rather just forces itself to a point where none of the movie feels smooth as the chaotic nature really just makes the movie more confusing than trying to help set the tension), Pacing was on the fast side (the movie really could have used 20 minutes to help with establishing aspects of the plot), Build to climax was not a build at all as it goes from 0 to 180 as the movie gets to its most tense part (an issue that happens throughout the movie); climax was actually a very tense part and a good watch, Tone was entirely inconsistent as it tries to be a black comedy and thriller throughout the movie but does not do a good job at establishing both as different plot elements are just forced on the audience rather than built, The movie does do a good job at building tension as the more tense scenes are entertaining to watch. Overall, a movie that is carried by the performances of Fiennes and Taylor-Joy as they both show their talent in staying afloat in a movie that has a very forced screenplay with an inconsistent tone, though it is an enjoyable watch that does have good moments.
The Fabelmans -13 
Very Good to Great Direction (Really is able to get the most out of his cast as well as use the cinematography and editing very well to drive the story forward; A lot of this direction is about building things on a grander scale and that is done in a very experienced/Spielberg way; it is very clear to the audience the personal touch of the movie is driving him to complete the story as he is basically telling the story of his own life (and how he wants his legacy to be known)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Very Good from Michelle Williams (Really shows her range throughout the movie as she can go from angry to depressed in a matter of seconds (but there are many moments where it feels very superficial/over-the-top)), Pretty Good from Paul Dano (Does not have too many faults in his performance but he really never gets into second or third gear in trying to display his distrust (and when he does it, it is not really the best considering I have seen him do this in the past with other roles); a performance that really is just the calm center for other characters to work off of but is not really able to get in real arguments when the time comes), Pretty Good from Seth Rogen (Plays a very anti-Seth Rogan character as he really gives off a very "I Love Lucy" style comedy that is super clean and family friendly (something that is just very hard to see from him); he does show off his dramatic chops in different scenes and when it does come out it is good), Good from Gabriel LaBelle (As a young lead, he did a good job in helping tell the story and be the introverted kid who wants to make movies when no one else believes in his dreams), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (The story for the first two thirds of the movie is a very good bildungsroman that really helps set up his family and his love of filmmaking, but the final third of the movie just becomes a cliche new-kid getting bullied in high school movie (with new conflicts getting introduced very late)), Very Good to Great Screenplay (Does a great job in making dialogue feel very natural and something of the time; the allusions to previous Spielberg movies were a very nice touch as it helps show how this movie is just an homage to his whole career; Spielberg does a very good job at foreshadowing the conflict present within the family through different clues that eventually come to a realization), Good Score (Very John Williams), Great Cinematography (Very similar in style to other Janusz Kamiński/Spielberg collaborations and feels very professional), Very Good Sound, Great Editing (especially when transitioning between time jumps in the plot), Plot Structure suffers from the movie being too long (the first two thirds of the movie are very well laid out and build to a good point, but the final third of the movie just feels really forced/unnecessary and causes the movie to drag on too much because of everything being introduced last minute), Pacing was good for the most part (but the final hour of the movie just felt very unnecessary and could have been cut out), Build to the climax is decent but it builds to a conflict that really should not have happened (as it built to a better climax for a different conflict earlier on in the movie); climax was fine and similar to other Spielberg movies of recent memory (but it was for a conflict that really was not the best), Tone of the movie was set nicely as it is following the coming-of-age trope with a 50-60s dynamic. Overall, a very personal movie from Spielberg that goes through his coming of age story as we see why he became a filmmaker and different homages to his most famous works, but overstays its welcome with the third act really falling apart and being cliche.

Pretty Good Direction (Does a Very good job at helping build the world and moving the story forward (plus helping create the action and suspense); but really does not do that well at directing his actors), Decent Acting (Pretty Bad from Sam Worthington (His performance felt very monotonous and did not really do well as the lead character (plus the voice is the exact same voice he does for Black Ops so that was all I could think about)), Pretty Good from Zoe Saldana, Good from Stephen Lang (Really commands himself well as the antagonist of the movie and inserts his presence well in all the scenes he is in), Decent from Michelle Rodriguez, Pretty Good from Sigourney Weaver, Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Decent Story (While the actual story is not bad, it is a bland copy of other movies that fall under the trope of a colonizer assimilating with a native tribe, making the story very predictable), Decent Screenplay (The concepts and names felt like they were made on the spot and the overall dialogue is just very standard for a Sci-fi movie; the allegory for the story is also incredibly obvious that the movie feels very preachy (exploiting natives for their resources and not caring about the humanity trope)), Good Score (Has some iconic elements to it), Good Cinematography (Kinda hard to gauge considering how much of the movie is CGI), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (This is based on for the time; with the advancement in technology since this movie came out, the movie looks incredibly dated), Plot Structure was very predictable given the trope, Pacing was fine for the most part (even with the longer runtime it does not feel like it overstays its welcome), Climax was very good as it is the most action packed part of the movie, Tone tries to be a mix of sci-fi and colonization movies but ends up being very bland overall, This movie has become incredibly dated as the years have gone on as it heavily relies on CGI to tell the story and build the world (so watching it years after it comes out makes the movie feel less groundbreaking). Overall, a groundbreaking film at the time it was released, but has become incredibly dated given how far technology has advanced since the movie was released, causing the movie to fall back on mediocre filmmaking with a very predictable/copied story due to how much the film relies on CGI to tell the story.
The Whale 13 
Decent to Pretty Good Direction (Aronofsky falls back to a style of filmmaking he has been accustomed to (the broken character film) and pulls from a lot of his experience because of it; however, because of this, the movie does not feel very innovative and has flavors of his past films; He does not direct the actors working well together as some moments feel very choppy and it feels like the actors have a hard time playing off each other), Pretty Bad Acting (Great to Incredible from Brendan Fraser (Gives the performance of his career as he fully transforms into this broken character looking for love despite not having that much time; fully embodies the struggles it takes to play someone of this size), Pretty Bad from Sadie Sink (A very one-dimensional performance considering her character is just an angsty teen (Plays basically a poor man's version of Max from Stranger Things)), Pretty Good from Hong Chau (A performance of ebbs and flows as some moments she is able to work well off of Fraser and stand on her own, and other times she has trouble working with the rest of the cast), Bad to Pretty Bad from Ty Simpkins (A very one-dimensional performance that is not redeeming at all), Pretty Bad from Samantha Morton (for the time she has, she really does not do that well to establish herself), ), Pretty Good Story (The construction was very tight and did make sense, there were just some plot elements that were just there really for shock (like the binge eating scenes); the ending was also a bit questionable despite how emotional it was), Decent Screenplay (The actual dialogue was very lackluster and surface level; the subtext for loneliness and the symbols they presented for it are actually very good and help keep the audience engaged with Charlie's life; there is also a bit of foreshadowing that does play well in helping execute the climax), Great Score (Is used very nicely throughout the movie to set the tone), Decent Cinematography (Very typical to other low-budget A24 movies), Decent Sound, Pretty Bad Editing (The movie just feels very choppy at times), Great Makeup (Especially with the prosthetics they used on Fraser), Plot Structure was laid out very nicely and pretty standard to other narratives, Pacing was a bit on the slower side but was a non-issue throughout the movie, Climax of the movie was incredibly touching as everything seems to be coming to an end with characters you get so closely attached to (but the final shot of the movie was very dumb and really ruins something beautiful they were building towards), Tone was very somber and depressing (and the director uses different elements very well to help with creating this). Overall, a movie that is carried by Fraser's performance with a story that is very heartbreaking, but feels very similar to other Aronofsky films (like Black Swan and The Wrestler) which takes away at something great they could have had, coupled with a hit-or-miss screenplay and questionable performances from the rest of the cast.
Avatar: The Way of Water -12 
Pretty Good Direction (Does a very good job at helping build the world and moving the story forward (plus helping create the action and suspense); does do a better job this time in getting more from his actors, but nothing seems very innovative since the last movie), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Decent from Sam Worthington (While there were similar flaws to the previous performance, he did improve a lot and shows a bit more experience this time around), Pretty Good from Zoe Saldaña, Pretty Good from Sigourney Weaver, Pretty Good from Stephen Lang (Kinda just plays the same character as last time and just goes off of the same villain trope that is pretty standard), Pretty Good from Kate Winslet, Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Bad to Pretty Bad Story (It honestly feels like the same story as the last movie and suffers from the same flaws as well; moreover, the movie just tries to fit in so much plot that the final part of the story just becomes boring considering how long the movie is), Pretty Bad to Decent Screenplay (The dialogue does improve a bit and does not feel as forced as last time (but still very similar to other Sci-Fi movies); the allegory for the story is literally the same as last time but it is just something else that is being exploited (once again exploiting natives for their resources and not caring about the humanity trope)), Good Score (Has some iconic elements to it and builds on the previous score), Great Cinematography (It is easier to tell now what is done using cinematography and it is very well done (even though most of the movie is CGI)), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Incredible Visual Effects (Even though it might become dated like the last movie, currently it was very stunning how pretty the movie was and how the use of CGI made this world not only above land but below it), Plot Structure was the same but dragged out more, Pacing was not the issue as it never felt super slow (but there is just so much plot that it drags for the final third of the movie to where it just gets really boring), Climax was good as it is the most action packed part of the movie, Tone tries to be a mix of sci-fi and colonization movies but ends up being very bland overall, This movie looks very good now but may turn out to be dated like the previous film (so it is hard to tell how it will hold up over time). Overall, an improvement in terms of the technical aspects and the acting, but overall just feels like the same movie as the first as the story coupled with the very long runtime make the movie pretty hard to watch towards the end (though it is still a decent watch in terms of how pretty the world they created was).
RRR -5 
Good to Very Good Direction (Did a very good job on a grad scale in creating a Telugu epic that is very watchable from a large scale audience, got the most out of his actors and commanded lead very well in helping drive the story forward), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Good to Very Good from N. T. Rama Rao Jr. (Was very typical like other Telugu movies, but he does show some more range than I thought he ever could; really commands lead throughout the movie and does a good job in helping drive the story forward), Good from Ram Charan (Plays his character very well as it is one filled with depth and range), Pretty Good from Ajay Devgn, Pretty Good from Alia Bhatt, Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (very typical of the white actors as well as extras in Indian movies)), Very Good Story (An actually captivating story that inspires patriotism as well as does a good job in laying out elements very nicely and showing what the characters want towards the end (though does falter a bit from the typical Telugu tropes)), Good Screenplay (For a Telugu script, it does not fall too much into the cliches of dialog (though there are many moments when it does) as the writing makes sense; the symbolism and the foreshadowing of the movie is actually surprisingly good for a Telugu movie), Good Score/Great Soundtrack (Very Good use of songs to help in telling the story (does not seem forced like in other Indian movies of the past)), Very Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Really shows how far Telugu movies have come in the technology they have to tell stories), Very Good Production Design (Really helps in setting the scene), Very Good Costumes (Helped with setting the time period, as well as the difference between the lower and higher classes), Plot Structure was laid out very nicely and it felt like all the elements of the plot were building off of each other, Pacing was good (especially for the long runtime as it felt like nothing was dragging as the length was used effectively to tell the story), Climax was very typical of an action sequence in a telugu movie (but was still very enjoyable), Tone was very typical to that of Telugu Epics (but it does contain flavors of patriotism and the wanting independence trope). Overall, a Telugu movie that does falter a bit from the given Telugu tropes, but overall transcends Tollywood as Rajamouli builds from the progress made from Baahubali to show what Telugu filmmaking can be as he creates a well digestible Epic that is driven by the performances of the two leads, good writing, and technical achievements in order to show India can stand on the same footing as the Western world in making films.

Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like a mess as everything is super chaotic and the narrative just gets very hard to follow as it goes on; Damien Chazelle really does not get the most out of his actors as he tries to really go for more shock than trying to get powerful performances from them), Decent Acting (Pretty Good from Brad Pitt (Really pulls more from experience to help get through this as his character just feels like a more chaotic version of the one he played in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but as it tries to get deeper it just misses the mark more), Pretty Good to Good from Margot Robbie (Uses the experience she has playing the socialites to help drive the performance as it just feels like she is playing a combination of characters she has played in the past), Pretty Good to Good from Diego Calva (Does a good job for the most part being the lens of the movie and really holds his own when working with more established actors), Pretty Bad from Jean Smart, Decent from Jovan Adepo (He is pent up to be a very important character but they just do not use him well enough to show what he can do), Decent from Li Jun Li, Bad to Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Just chaotic overall and a lot of the performances feel like overacting)), Pretty Bad Story (The actual theme of the movie is somewhat interesting, but the plot itself is just incredibly long and the elements really do not work well off of each other as it feels like the story is progressing but going backwards at the same time (even though it could be argued this is intentional)), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The symbolism just feels very shallow and the foreshadowing is very predictable; the dialogue is also very forced and superficial), Good Score, Pretty Good Cinematography (There were many shots from a grand scale that make the movie look very nice as it helped with establishing the big sets and scenes, but the constant fast moving of the camera to help with making the movie chaotic really got nauseating at times as it felt very amateurish), Pretty Good Sound, Very Bad Editing (It just tries to hard to be shock but ends up just being nauseating; Also the editing towards the end just feels like something a 5 year old would do), Good Visual Effects, Good to Very Good Production Design (Does do a good job in helping establish the time period), Plot Structure was very bad as it was just a chaotic mess of elements trying to movie the story forward (with the resolution basically being unnecessary as the movie could have ended at the climax and still would have been the same movie), Pacing was very bad as the movie drags a lot after the halfway point of the movie as it tries to fit in so much plot that is very unnecessary to tell the story (45-60 minutes of the movie could have been cut and it would have been the same movie), Climax was interesting (but still has elements of shock that are really unnecessary); the ending of the movie was completely unnecessary and the final scene felt really awkward and forced for no reason, Tone was really trying to be comedic with a mix of chaos and black comedy (but there were many awkward silences that just made the movie feel more awkward and grotesque than what it was trying to go for). Overall, a chaotic mess from a talented director as he fails to direct his poorly constructed narrative cause he tries too hard to go for shock and humor that it goes for grotesque and unwatchable, so much to the point that even the competent performances cannot even save the train-wreck that is over three hours long.
After Yang 19 
Pretty Bad to Decent Direction (Good job at moving the story forward, but with the movie being very slow and the tone really not being that captivating means his direction could only go so far; moreover, it really does not feel like he is getting the most out of his actors as it feels very choppy and held back), Decent Acting (Pretty Good to Good from Colin Farrell (Shows some depth and range in his performance, but really is not given that much to work with), Decent to Pretty Good from Jodie Turner-Smith (Does not really show any emotion in her performance but does hold her own pretty well when working off other actors), Decent from Justin H. Min (Really is not in the movie that long but does do a decent job in portraying a curious robot), Pretty Good to Good from Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja (Really plays the child character wanting something that is lost very well, shows a good amount of depth and is a real star from the movie), Bad from the rest of the cast (everything just feels emotionless and inexperienced)), Pretty Good Story (With a shortened screen-time, the movie makes no waste in trying to get the most out of its plot elements and progressing the story forward), Pretty Good Screenplay (the conversations of the movie did feel natural and of a technological utopian; the symbolism of the movie was good and did help show some limelight into the humanity of Artificial Intelligence), Score was very minimal and really did not play too much into the movie, Decent Cinematography, Pretty Bad Sound (made the silence of the movie pretty deafening), Decent Editing (felt a bit amaturish), Pretty Good Visual Effects (especially for how low the budget was), Pretty Good Production Design (helped bring that futuristic element to the movie), Plot Structure was very simplistic and laid out well (no bells and whistles), Pacing was a bit on the slower side at felt like it dragged a bit (if maybe 15 minutes of the movie was cut and the pacing was a bit faster then the movie would have been more captivating but it would also take away from its charm), Climax was a bit anti-climatic (but it was necessary given what the movie does try to portray), Tone played into the sci-fi elements which made it very much on the dull/slow-burn side so the movie was a bit hard to follow at times as it could get a bit boring (the lack of score/sound at many points definitely added to this). Overall, a slow-burn that is a quick representation of how AI can make an impact on families as this family looks for the humanity of their artificial child, bringing in some interesting ideas but ultimately ends up being a bit boring and hard to follow because of the very dull tone and lack of direction.
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish 5 
Great Direction (Does a Great job at moving the story forward through the use of symbols and ideas that are very mature to a children's movie; really helps blend the fun nature of Puss in Boots with the serious nature of the plot and also fits in the fighting scenes very well to keep the audience engaged with what is going on), Very Good Voice Acting (Great from Antonio Banderas (Really plays the role with experience but also adds depth in showing the more depressing side of Puss' life as he has to come to terms with his new reality), Very Good from Salma Hayek Pinault (Plays off the other cast mates very well and does a good job in helping bring emotion out of Puss), Very Good from Harvey Guillén (Plays the adorable comic relief character very well and acts as the moral compass throughout the movie), Good from Florence Pugh, Pretty Good from John Mulaney (It was very obvious it was John Mulaney throughout the movie), Very Good from Wagner Moura (Played the true villain of the movie very well), Good from the rest of the cast), Great to Incredible Story (The actual story is very simple in that there a journey from point A to point B, but the sub-elements and the journey towards the end are very complex as the characters really find out what they want from life; the actual concept of the journey also stems from the fairy-tale aspect that made Shrek very famous; the use of it being Puss' last life was also a good touch), Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue is very clever and is written very well to have innuendos for both a younger and more mature audience; the symbolism and foreshadowing was great for a children's movie and really is a lot deeper than many children's movies have gone before), Pretty Good Score, Good Sound, Great Editing, Incredible Visual Effects/Animation (Really takes from the Spider-verse style and runs with it as it feels very cartoony with some shades of Anime (Something that is a breath of fresh air to the animated movie space); the fight scenes were were well animated and really enjoyable to watch), Plot Structure was laid out very well as all the elements flowed well into each other and the conclusion was met after everything was resolved, Pacing was very good as it did not really feel like any time was needed to be cut or added, Climax was great as the fighting mixed with the animation made the scenes very captivating, Tone had elements that were similar to a children's movie but also had elements that were from the hero's journey (with some mixes of depressing tones to show puss' anxiety), A great representation of how anxiety and ego take effect on an individual as it masks Puss' fear of death very well with the backdrop of it being a children's movie (something not only few animated films have done but any film really). Overall, a movie that at the surface plays very well for children as it follows the iconic Puss in Boots on his adventure, but overall has a much stronger and deeper meaning of living life without fear and anxiety as the creators synergized incredible animation with great writing to make this movie a must watch.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery -109 
Good Direction (Keeps a very similiar style to the previous film as he moves the narrative in a similar way and is able to get the most out of his actors again), Very Good Acting (The cast as a whole works well off of each other as Daniel Craig acts as the voice of reason to get the most out of these flawed humans), Good Story (The actual story is good and very on par to the first as the first, but the construction is a bit awkward with the story being told twice (just from different perspectives)), Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue is very whitty and the comedic elements do hit; the symbolism and foreshadowing is one of the better parts of the movie as it helps make it a true Who-done-it; the elements of the screenplay that were very topical were very annoying to see as it talked about COVID (which got really annoying)), Pretty Good Score (helped with setting the mood), Very Good Cinematography (Helps with creating the mystery and suspense), Good Sound (Helps with creating the mystery and suspense), Very Good Editing (Helped with creating mystery and the suspense), Pretty Good Visual Effects (Not one of the focal points of the movie but is good at keeping the movie intersting), Very Good Production Design (A stark contrast to the first film as that dealt more with wintery scenes while this movie tried to create a Summer vibe through its sets), Good Costumes (Helps with creating that summer feel), Plot Structure was kinda an issue with this movie as the movie tries to tell the story twice to show two different points of view (when the second point of view could have been half of the time as it mostly just drags the story), Pacing was good for the most part (but 20 minutes of the movie could have been cut (especially when retelling the story), Climax was very good as it helps build to show how flawed these characters are and how the truth is not super certain to be told, Tone is very similar in style to the previous film as it is still a who-done-it (but there are flavors to make the movie have more of a happier and jollier feel with it being set in the summer). Overall, a sequel that is pretty on par with the first as it takes many aspects (like the overall who-done-it style for a cast of flawed characters) while still trying to be different (like giving it more of a Summer feel), but does not live up entirely as the story construction (especially the retelling of the story) and topical nature of the movie (bringing up COVID) holds it back a bit.
8 Mile -49 
Good Direction (Helps move the story pretty well and does a good job getting a good amount out of the main actors (but really falters when working with the supporting/minor characters); the direction really gets highlighted during the rap battle scenes as he is able to create such a captivating environment with scenes that are just so entertaining to watch), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Good from Eminem (Has some moments of inexperience but really plays the lead well as he draws from personal experience to help tell the story), Pretty Good to Good from Mekhi Phifer (Plays the best friend character well and is able to work with Eminem nicely), Pretty Good from Brittany Murphy (Is not really given that much to work with but does a pretty good job at playing the female lead well), Pretty Bad from Kim Basinger (Really suprising how poorly she plays this character given her last performance with this director won her an oscar; just does not hit any of the depressing notes that are needed from her character and does not work well with other actors), Pretty Good to Good from Michael Shannon (Really steals the show in the scenes he is in as he shows glimpses of an actors that will have acclaim in the future), Bad to Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of inexperience and lack of depth in any of the characters)), Very Good Story (The semi-autobiographical nature of the story really looks into Eminem's upbringing to show how hard it was for him to grow and make a name for himself in the rap community), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue is very simplistic and is a bit lacking in comparison to the other; the lyricism of the wraps are very well written and definitely a highlight of the movie; the foreshadowing and symbolism is a but surface level as the story really is meant to show the race divisions of Detroit and the Rap community), Great Score/Soundtrack (The score is just an interpolation of Lose Yourself but that song is just so good that this is a plus; the soundtrack), Pretty Good Cinematography, Good Sound (Really helped when mixing the hip-hop elements with the story), Pretty Good Editing, Plot Structure was pretty standard and boilerplate (the typical underdog story getting his shot at the end), Pacing was good (there was no need to cut or add any time), Climax was great and the best part of the movie (it really shows how Rabbit finally gets the confidence to show off his lyricism as he spits some of the most famous bars not only in movie history but rap history), Tone was set well (helped with really establishing the scene and the grime of the ghetto in Detroit). Overall, an entertaining movie that has really great moments and showcases great hip-hop, all lead by a good performance from Eminem as he drives the movie to a great climax of Rap Battles, but is held back a bit from the pretty standard/boilerplate elements and not great performances from the minor characters.
M3GAN -24 
Decent Direction (Moves the story well and does a good job setting the tone; but the cheap use of horror elements was very predictable, and the acting is not really the best), Pretty Bad Acting  (Decent to Pretty Good from Allison Williams (Holds her own decently well as the lead but really has no depth or emotion throughout the movie), Decent from Jenna Davis (There really is only one delivery level to the performance but there are no main issues), Decent from Violet McGraw, Bad to Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Really just a lot of inexperience and monotonous performances)), Pretty Bad Story (The story is pretty typical of regular horror movies of the same trope with the actual plot being pretty predictable), Pretty Bad to Decent Screenplay (Typical horror movie dialogue (though the jokes and non-sequitur moments were pretty funny); the symbolism and foreshadowing is really surface level), Decent Score (Used well in conjuction to help build suspense), Pretty Good Cinematography (Pretty standard but used well to help build the horror), Decent to Pretty Good Sound (Used to help build horror elements, but a bit overused to help rely on jumpscares), Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Good Visual Effects (With the budget they had, they did a good job in creating the animatronics), Plot Structure was kinda a fault of the movie as it spends a bit too much time on the exposition that it really pushes away building the conflict and the keeps the climax shorter than it could be, Pacing was slower in the beginning and pretty fast after the 40 minute mark (really could have cut 10-15 minutes from the exposition to keep the pacing consistent overall), climax was pretty typical to horror movies with some action component, tone was pretty atypical of horror movies as well there are moments of suspense, the movie does do a decent job in incorporating comedic elements to lighten the tone. Overall, a movie that does a decent job at mixing horror elements with comedy, but falters when coming to direction, acting, and story as it is just a modern retelling of the possessed doll trope (which makes it pretty predictable).
