Fargo 0 
Very Good Direction, Good Acting (Great from Frances McDormand, Very Good from William H. Macy, Good to Very Good from Steve Buscemi, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Good from the remaining main cast, and decent from the supporting cast and extras)), Great Story (though is very surface level in its imagery and symbolism), Great Screenplay (laced with witty, quirky midwestern dialogue (as seen by the intentional awkward pauses during the Minnesotan conversations)), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Especially the distant panning shots that show the contrast between the main images and the snow), Pacing is Great for the most part given its short runtime (but is incredibly rushed towards the end (particularly the final 15-20 minutes)). Overall, the Coen brothers give a prime example of why they are some of the best screenwriters in Hollywood as they make a short runtime filled with many memorable, funny moments (even though it may not be as incredible as their other movies), but it does falter towards the end as it is incredibly rushed as it feels like it could've used 15 more minutes to keep up to the pace it had for the majority of the movie.
A Clockwork Orange 4 
Very Good to Great Direction, Very Good Acting (Great Acting from Malcolm McDowell, Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (Very true to the source material), Great Screenplay (Very hard to understand and watch at first as it is very Shakespearean due to the fictional Nadsat language they use, but once you overcome the first 30 mins, the screenplay gradually increases to where it is incredible towards the end), Great Score/Soundtrack (Especially with the use of classical music along with its iconic original score), Incredible Cinematography (Very Kubrick in style), Incredible Production Design, Pacing is great ( broken up into 3 distinct parts (like the book) that gradually increases towards the climax), climax is very intense and keeps the audience in their seat. Overall, a movie that is very hard to watch in the first 1/3 (both because of imagery, understanding the dialogue, plot, and pace), but once you get past that point, it is an great to incredible piece of art that shows the line between psychological treatment and free will as well as the ability for the redemption of the lost.
Boyz n the Hood 17 
Good to Very Good Direction, Good Acting (The cast overall works well with each other (especially the main cast)), Great Story (Emotional and makes you feel for the character's struggles), Very Good Screenplay, Pretty Good Score (Gives it a very 80s Law and Order SVU vibes), Good Pacing (Keeps a constant steady pace). Overall, a Good movie to show the struggles of living in South Central LA and how those who dream to get out may not even get the chance.
Full Metal Jacket 65 
Great Direction, Good Acting (Good from Matthew Modine, Good from Vincent D'Onofrio, Very Good from Lee Ermey, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Most were pretty good but some were mediocre)), Good to Very Good Story (Very good in the boot camp (first 40%) and Good during the Vietnam War parts), Great Screenplay (Deviates from the source material but is still very whitty and bends the line between comical and serious very well), Cinematography (Very Kubrick in style but still is a bit different as it still has similar tones to traditional war movies), Pacing was generally very slow but consistent to Kubrick style pacing, The build to the climax is not that well done as there are many jumps in the narrative and the resolution does not really exist, Very well choreography war scenes. Overall, a good movie that shows the horrors of war and the effects it has on soldiers, but is very shallow in its meaning and message when compared to Kubrick's other films.
Whiplash 44 
Incredible Direction, Very Good to Great Acting (Great from Miles Teller, Brilliant from J. K. Simmons, Good from the rest of the cast), Brilliant Story, Brilliant Screenplay, Incredible Score, Great Cinematography (Brilliant use of lighting to establish mood and themes), Incredible Editing, Pacing is Great to Incredible as it gives it a very artsy feel that slowly builds to a brilliant climax, climax is brilliant as it is filled with symbolism till the very last shot as JKs mouth is covered showing his recognition is all that Andrew needed to think he is one of the greats. Overall, one of, if not the best, movies to show the obsession of an artist that wants to make it to the top, stopping at nothing to get there, as they are pushed past their mental breaking point to achieve their goal.
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby 30 
Pretty Good Direction, Pretty Good Acting (A surprisingly studded all star cast where each actor plays their role very well, but there are issues (Cohen's accent  was very annoying and characters, like Amy Adams, were overacting at times)), Very Good Screenplay (Very funny movie (Stupid funny but funny); Most jokes hit but when they miss its pretty eh; very Will Ferrell in its joke telling in that he breaks the pace or adds on to a joke to make it funnier (This either hits or can be annoying at times)), Pretty Good Sound Editing/Mixing, Pretty Good Editing, Pacing was intentionally fast (which leaves no room for development), the build to the climax really is ok but definitely could've been better. Overall, a fun movie to watch for leisure that has many jokes that hit very well and are very quotable, even though it may be stupid funny.
Elf 28 
Very Good Direction (Especially for the lengths Jon Favreau went to limit the use of CGI), Good Acting (Very Good from Will Ferrell, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone plays their part well)), Very Good/Iconic Story (Although it is filled with cliches and is very safe), Very Good Screenplay, Great Cinematography (Uses force perspective very well (even though it can lead to inconsistencies at times)), Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Especially for the stop motion parts of the film to give is a very classic Christmas movie feel), Pacing was pretty good overall, Build to climax is pretty abrupt but the overall ending is pretty intense for a Christmas movie and Favreau pulls it off very well. Overall, an iconic christmas movie that is filled with many emotions, makes you root for the characters, and makes you remember the spirit of christmas, even though the movie is very safe, formulaic, cliche, and plays its cards very close to its chest (something I can't really blame given its a family Christmas movie).
A Christmas Story 70 
Pretty Good Direction, Pretty Good Acting (from the entire cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (Pretty funny but is extremely slow in its pacing and is longer than it needs to be), Decent Screenplay (With "You'll shoot your eye out kid" being an iconic quote in all of cinema), Plot Structure is on the spectrum as the build to the climax is throughout the whole movie and pulls it off decently well but the movie needed to end after the last use of the "iconic line" because all the scenes after that are pretty pointless and make the movie feel like its dragging more than it should, Pacing is very slow as the movie seems incredibly long despite the fact that it is surprisingly only a little over an hour and a half, Narration made the story a lot slower than it needed to be and kinda dragged away from what was being told. Overall, a movie that is kinda overrated, has not aged that well compared to other christmas movies, and has incredible pacing and length issues, but is still an entertaining watch for the family during Christmas time..
Soul -38 
Great Direction, Good Voice Acting (From the cast as a whole (with Tina Fay being a standout)), Great Story (Though pretty predictable, especially the ending), Great Screenplay, Very Good Score, Incredible Animation (The best animation from Pixar by far), Pacing was Decent, Build to climax is good and the climax was very well done, the themes and concepts were very thought provoking and were very well executed (especially for a kids movie). Overall, a great Pixar movie (probably mid-tier) that is filled with incredible animation and thought-provoking themes, even though it has a predictable plot.
Monsters, Inc. 63 
Incredible Direction, Incredible Voice Acting (Brilliant from Billy Crystal (May have the best voice acting performance of all time as Mike), Incredible from the rest of the cast), Brilliant Story (Especially character writing), Incredible Screenplay (Filled with emotions and wit/humor), Great Score, Plot Structure is great as all the scenes add to the plot as there is nothing wasted, Pacing is Great (Given its short runtime), Build to the climax is very evident and the climatic sequence is executed very well, Only drawback for the movie is that it is too short. Overall, the best Pixar movie (a little biased) that shows the loving dynamic of a father-daughter relationship through an animation filled adventure; lives up to how much I loved it as a kid and more, especially Mike Wazowski.
The Departed 102 
Incredible Direction, Incredible Acting (From the cast as a whole (Standouts being Leonardo DiCaprio (in his 2nd best role behind Wolf), Mark Walburg, and Jack Nicholson (Even though its pretty over-the-top))), Incredible Story (Filled with symbols of the dark nature of the subject manner (the quest of the rat)), Incredible Screenplay (Mixes humor and trauma extremely effectively), Decent Cinematography (Not a huge fan of the still cuts edited with the shifting cinematography), Decent Editing (See cinematography), Plot Structure was good for the most part (but the beginning was a bit hard to understand (but can get past this after the first 20-30 mins)), Pacing was generally good but there are some slower parts meant for character development (not a huge problem); The movie was a bit on the longer side but there really isn't that many scenes that could be cut (so it gets a pass), Build to the climax is incredible with the ending being extremely suspenseful and unpredictable. Overall, a movie that is a must watch, even with its small faults, as it uses Boston wit and humor laced into a story and screenplay to show the effects trauma and crime can have on people stuck in the rat race as the push through through what is ethical, in what is a Martin Scorsese masterpiece.
First Blood 53 
Good Direction, Pretty Good Acting (Great from Sylvester Stallone (though I'm biased), Pretty Good from Richard Crenna, Decent from the rest of the cast), Very Good Story (Actually handles PTSD from Vietnam pretty well), Minimal Screenplay (Works to show how traumatized Rambo is), Pretty Bad Sound Editing/Mixing (A bit off (but thats the 80s for yah)), Pacing is very fast as it is fueled by its action (with a very short runtime that would have definitely benefited from 15-20 minutes of character building or exposition), Build to the climax was pretty good with the overall climax executed very well as we see all the sides of Rambo, Action is what keeps the movie going as Rambo constantly builds up his arsenal with the more kills he gets (but it is important to note that many of the actions that Rambo did were extremely unnecessary and escalated the situation a lot more than it needed to be. Overall, a movie that is a fun action movie to watch as Sly gives off one of his iconic performances to create a signature character that is a war machine suffering from PTSD that is trying his best to just to live in a post-Vietnam, anti-war society.
Reservoir Dogs 33 
Good Direction, Good Acting (By the whole cast (With Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel standing out the most)), Good Story, Great Screenplay (very Tarantino-esque), Pretty Good Editing (Tarantino-esque), Plot Structure is very minimal as the audience is thrown right at the end and they have to put pieces together throughout, Pacing was all over the place given the way the narrative was told (No fault really); very short runtime (which is fine because there is very little plot), There really isn't any climax to build too (No fault given that you start at the very end), The feel and style of the movie has a very similar feel to Usual Suspects (But I liked this one more), A lot of mistakes and misses which shows in Tarantino's first film (Definitely can see his growth throughout his career). Overall, a "Usual Suspects" type film that is a good watch with good moments as the audience gets to see a sloppy, amateur filmmaker that is looking to make a name for himself (in what became a great launching point for one of the best filmmakers ever).
No Country for Old Men -52 
Incredible Direction, Great to Incredible Acting (Great from Tommy Lee Jones, Brilliant from Javier Bardem, Very Good from Josh Brolin, Very Good from Kelly MacDonald, Very Good from the rest of the cast (Even though they can be dull at times)), Incredible Story (Incredibly true to the source material (Like almost to a tee)), Incredible Screenplay (Extremely metaphorical in both dialogue and actions), Score is very minimal (Stylistic choice), Great Cinematography, Incredible Sound Editing/Mixing (Given the fact the movie relies entirely on sound), Great Editing, Pacing is a very slow steady pace (A slow burn time movie); Uses Runtime very well as every minute of the 2 hours is used effectively, Tone is very monotonous and dull (Kinda a drawback for me), The gorey/violent scenes are extremely detailed and well made. Overall, a movie that is extremely metaphorical in nature about the world moving towards an evil that the old cannot adapt to that is filled with Iconic Dialogue, Great Action moments, and Incredible performances that make the movie a must watch that is incredibly true to the source material, even the though the pace is very slow and the tone is very dull.
American Psycho 33 
Decent Direction, Pretty Bad Acting (Good from Christian Bale (Plays the serial killer very well but can be very pretentious at times (which is extremely annoying to watch)), Pretty Good from Willem Dafoe, Pretty Good from Jared Leto, Bad to Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (annoyingly pretentious)), Very Good to Great Story, Decent Screenplay (But filled with many iconic/memeable lines), Build to the climax happens suddenly as that part of the movie really shows the lapses in reality (leading to the dilemma at the end), The killing scenes were the best parts of the movie as the gore/violence/madness of Patrick Bateman was really displayed; though, the rest of the movie is very pretentious (which makes it end up being very memey when it is trying to be serious). Overall, a decent movie that shows moments of greatness from a future star (Bale and somewhat Leto) as the movie has good moments to watch (like the killing scenes and the overanalyzing from Bateman), but there are a lot of flaws in the movie that make it very hard to watch at times when looking at the greed of wall street from a very surface level, pretentious lense..
The Royal Tenenbaums -6 
Good Direction, Good Acting (The cast overall was good (but individual performances were pretty good to decent from how bland they can be)), Good Story, Good Screenplay (but quirky), Good Cinematography (Was Wes Anderson to a Tee from the amount of shots/angle changes), Good Editing, There really was no real plot to movie but themes of overcoming a toxic family dynamic was shown very well. Overall, a pretty good watch that shows how broken pieces of a family can still come together to make a single unit through adversity in what is a prime example of Wes Anderson filmmaking with its quirks and cinematography.
Demon Slayer: Mugen Train 3 
Good Direction,  (), Good to Very Good Story, Very anime-esque Screenplay (But did have very emotional points that were carried out very well), Good Score, Incredible Animation/Action Sequences,  Pacing was very off considering first half was story and the second half was just an entire fight sequence, The build-up to the end was great but the ending was very anticlimactic/poorly done. Overall, even though I do not watch the show/anime, I thought it was a good movie and is a nice visual/change of pace movie to watch to get people back into theaters.
Rush 53 
Good Direction, Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Daniel Brühl, Good from the rest of the cast), Good to Very Good Story (Pretty true to the story), Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing (Very unique editing sequences that were good at times and very extra at others), The movie felt very short and rushed a lot in terms of the plot (no pun intended). Overall, a good movie that I will compare a lot to Ford v. Ferrari where this movie had a better story and was more serious while the other movie is more of a fun watch with better technicals.
The Dark Knight Rises 73 
Great Direction (Incredible Direction at a grand scale but the interpersonal scenes were kinda lacking at times), Very Good Acting (Incredible acting by the main cast (Tom Hardy a huge standout), though the extras/side characters were pretty meh at times), Incredible Story, Great to Incredible Screenplay (though some of the dialogue did feel stiff at times; filled with iconic quotes from Bane and others), Incredible Score, Incredible Cinematography (in Wally Pfister's last movie with Nolan), Incredible Sound, Incredible Editing, Plot Structure was very steady and built very well to the climax, Climax was Brilliant not only for the movie but for the trilogy as a whole, Movie had some of the best points and highlights in the entire trilogy (but there were some scenes that were meh). Overall, one of the best endings for a trilogy that ties a lot of the loose ends together and closes The Dark Knight story in an incredible fashion.
Saw 40 
Pretty Bad Direction (Direction for traps and plot elements was good but was horrible besides that (especially with dialogue and interpersonal scenes)), Terrible Acting (), Great Story (has very iconic elements to it that are filled with twists and turns that are not expected), Very Bad Screenplay (Though it does had iconic lines and moments at times), Great Score (Iconic score with an iconic theme), Great Production Design (Captures a dark, dirty, and scary environment), The buildup to the climax was gradual and fine but the actual climax really was not carried out well (Though post climax/ending was very well carried out and iconic in showing the twists of the story), The trap scenes were very well executed to show the fear in the characters. Overall, for a movie with such a low budget, the creators were able to develop the most from what they could as they created an iconic story line that is a mainstay in the horror franchise, even though it may not be the best in its presentation..
The Exorcist -16 
Great Direction, Great Acting (By the entire cast (Standouts were Miller, Burstyn, and Blair)), Very Good to Great Story, Great Screenplay (Filled with symbolism on Crisis of Faith), Good Score (Iconic Theme but the lack of a score at most parts made the film more boring), Great Editing, Visual Effects (For the time), Great Makeup (For the time), Plot Structure was an issue (the first 30 minutes of the movie were extremely boring and pointless to the story (if this was cut and spread throughout the movie for the allusion of the possession and actual exorcism could make the movie a lot better)), Pacing was completely off cause it was a tale of two movies: first half was extremely boring and slow while the second half was very fast paced and exciting, Climax was extremely intense and very scary as it shows the devil's work in the possession (Something that was very ahead of its time), Many plot holes/lead-ups that are never addressed. Overall, even though the movie does falter a lot in the development of its plot and pacing, The Exorcist is a groundbreaking movie in the horror genre (With its direction, screenplay, and acting) and stands up to be one of the most iconic movies not only in its genre but all time..
Lost in Translation 79 
Decent Direction (with its best moments being the conversations between Scarjo and Murray), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Bill Murray, Good to Very Good from Scarlett Johansson, There really wasn't a supporting cast for the movie), Pretty Bad to Decent Story (The story was a decent concept but really nothing happens in this movie), Pretty Bad to Decent Screenplay (The screenplay was meant to be awkward and being 'lost in translation' and it did capture that well, but I also felt that it made the movie very boring and dull because of it), Good Cinematography (For the equipment and budget they had (But could be a bit off at times)), Pacing was constant and slow so nothing to complain, The entire movie was basically just panning shots mixed with close ups of the actors faces plus improv dialogue in conversations; The symbolism and capturing the loneliness of being in a foreign country and finding love when you already have it was not as well captured as people say it is for this movie because I definitely feel that it was not displayed well enough (even if it was subtle). Overall, a movie that is pretty overrated as the movie is basically just shots of Japan that is mixed with good dialogue and scenes between Bill Murray and Scarjo, but in the end falters from its lack of story and very dull presentation (as it fails to capture to true aspects of loneliness).
Catch Me If You Can 75 
Great Direction, Great Acting (Great to Incredible from Leonardo DiCaprio, Great to Incredible from Tom Hanks, Great to Incredible Acting from Christopher Walken, Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (Stays pretty true to the source material), Great Screenplay (Filled with foreshadowing), Good Score, Pacing was great up until the final like 20 minutes (probably could have cut it down to 10), The build to the climax was incredible as the standoff scene between Leo and Hanks really showed both actor's best in displaying the anxiety and fright in the situation. Overall, a great film that is one of the most entertaining films to watch as it is a thrill of a ride to see all the different scams Frank Abagnale was able to pull off from the very start to the very end, something that really keeps you engaged at all times.
Tropic Thunder 52 
Great Direction, Very Good to Great Acting (Incredible from Robert Downey Jr., Very Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (Extremely funny story that is effective satire to a core), Very Good Screenplay (Filled with jokes that are reeks of 00s esque comedy but still very funny and quotable), Plot Structure was simple with very cheesy plot cliches yet still effective at mocking hollywood and oscars, Pacing was good, Build to climax was very good. Overall, a movie that is iconic for its edgy humor and star studded cast that was able to mock and make fun of the oscars so much that they could build an oscar campaign for RDJ, and actually get him a nomination (something legendary in itself).
Brokeback Mountain 51 
Incredible to Brilliant Direction (Both on a macro scale with the subjects in vast shots, and on a micro scale with interpersonal dialogue), Great to Incredible Acting (Incredible from Heath Ledger, Incredible from Jake Gyllenhaal, Very Good to Great from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (though a bit confusing on passage of time), Incredible Screenplay (Beautiful), Great Score (Molded well to the emotions of the characters and the beauty of the scenes), Incredible Cinematography (Able to capture the beauty of both the landscapes and how the leads were able to escape and find love there), Plot Structure was consistent; Runtime was fine but there were definitely scenes that could have been cut to make it a bit shorter, Pacing was fine but it was very confusing on what scenes took place in what year cause it jumps a lot (even showing it subtly would have helped), There isn't that much of a climax (More of a build to a shock and reaction?). Overall, a very beautiful movie (both in scenery and acting/dialogue) that is one of the best depictions of falling in love I have ever seen, as the two lead male characters have to escape to a beautiful seclusion to show their true love for each other, something society won't let them do.
Mystic River -8 
Great to Incredible Direction, Great Acting (Incredible from Sean Penn, Great to Incredible from Tim Robbins, Very Good to Great from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (especially how it analyzes the effects of trauma on an individual), Great Screenplay (With incredible moments and questionable moments), Decent Score, Good Editing, Plot Structure was very good as there are two parallel stories to try and look for the killer (Though the development of Kevin Bacon's character was a bit confusing on how it was presented), Pacing was on the slower side but pretty good overall; runtime was decent (but there were definitely scenes that could be cut as they were unnecessary, bout like 10-15 minutes worth), The build to the climax was great with the climax being incredible as well as the falling action and finding out the true story of the killing; the resolution was kinda poor and not carried out well, One of the best portrayals of trauma and grief I have ever seen carried out. Overall, a Great to Incredible movie that is one of the best presentations on the effects loss and trauma can have on people as the leads try to come to terms with what they have experienced, all symbolized in an very well carried out murder mystery.
The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 0 
The embodiment and magnum opus of Spongebob Squarepants that has some of the happiest and saddest moments (You know the scene) witnessed during my childhood
Ex Machina 48 
Great Direction (Like the stylistic choices he made by interweaving the scenic shots/sets with the character's dialogue), Good Acting (Pretty Good from Domhnall Gleeson, Very Good from Oscar Isaac, Very Good from Alicia Vikander, Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (Shows the effects of AI and actually putting trust into cognizant automata), Very Good to Great Screenplay (While the movie was pretty spot on with some of the technical jargon/ideas, it also definitely forced in a lot of buzz words that no programmer/software engineer would ever say), Great to Incredible use of the score in how it blended with the mood/feelings the audience has towards what is presented (especially when there is a heartbeat increasing to show the story becoming more tense), Great to Incredible Cinematography (espiecially how it it used the different intensities/colors of lighting to show the mood), Incredible Visual Effects (especailly for a movie with a lower budget), Incredible Production Design, Plot Structure was great, Pacing was good (Runtime was good), Build to the climax was great but the overall climax/resolution felt very off (even though the events of the movie were exactly how I expected/wanted to happen). Overall, a film that is very visually pleasing (an artsy movie that actually pulls it off very nicely) and well made that makes society question AI and how cognizant we should make Automata (definitely one of the better portrayals of this phenomenon), even if the film blows it more out of proportion/exaggerates the extent/ideas behind it.
The Sixth Sense -2 
Good Direction (especially in the horror parts), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Very Good from Haley Joel Osment, ), Good Story, Good Screenplay (Some great aspects/iconic lines and some mediocre to decent ones), Decent Score (Very James Newton Howard-esque), Plot Structure was ok but really doesn't go anywhere, Pacing was fine (could be a bit slow at times and very rushed at others), The film really does not have any climax (will get to the 'twist' in a bit), as nothing really happens (don't want to spoil anything but there really isn't any resolution), The horror parts of the movie were very well executed and definitely showed some of M.Night's best work as the audience definitely is on the edge of their seat; the famous 'twist' at the end while iconic is filled with plot holes and is can be easily picked up when watching the movie (like I did know it but still could have picked it up if I didn't). Overall, a pretty good movie (especially for horror) that has a lot of bright moments (like Haley Joel Osment) that put me on the edge of my seat and make the movie a horror classic (putting M.Night on the map), even though it falters a lot in terms of the plot holes and lackluster moments.
In Bruges 47 
Very Good to Great Direction (Especially how he molds the classical elements with the humor and serious moments), Very Good Acting (Great from Colin Farrell, Great from Brendan Gleeson, Very Good from Ralph Fiennes, Good from the rest of the cast), Good to Very Good Story, Very Good to Great Screenplay (Very funny, politically incorrect screenplay that is great with the serious aspects as well (can be a bit repetitive but thats just the nature of the dialogue)), Great Score (Especially in how it molds well to display the classical scenery of Bruges), Pretty Bad Sound (Very overbearing at times in the movie (making it hard to pay attention to what was going on at times)), Pacing is good with runtime used effectively, The build to the climax was good and the ending was open-ended in a way that was done very well, Handles elements of grief over past actions pretty well for a comedy (though not really the best) and handles elements of purpose on heaven/hell pretty well for a comedy. Overall, a surprisingly very good to great comedy that mixes serious elements of purpose and grief very well with politically incorrect, hilarious dialogue as it goes through the lives of the two leads trying to come to terms with the actions of their past.
The Shawshank Redemption 54 
Incredible Direction, Great Acting (Great from Tim Robbins, Great from Morgan Freeman, Very Good to Great from the rest of the cast), Brilliant Story (Beautiful Story that looks at the effects Prison has on a man), Brilliant Screenplay (Mixed with symbolism that drives the narrative forward), Very Good to Great Score, Great Cinematography (Especially for how it was used as a tool to display symbolism), Good Editing, Plot Structure was good cause even though the passage of time was not that evident it helped add to the symbolism of losing life and sense of time in prison, Pacing was a bit on the slower side but consistent throughout; Runtime was used effectively even though it was a bit long because every scene is used effectively (very few scenes could be cut), The climax/twist was executed very effectively and shows the extent in which characters had to go to proclaim their freedom, Emotions and mood were executed effectively because you really care for the subjects/scenes of the movie. Overall, an incredibly beautiful story on the effects prison has on men (especially innocent men) as they have to come to terms with their lives as they are stripped away from their freedom and have to continue to find hope even though the system keeps on trying to strip it away from them (something that makes you care for the subjects and makes you cheer and cry for them); moreover, the film is 1/3 of the trio of 1994 that is the embodiment of cinema before that year (given by the story telling and feel of the movie being from the 50s-60s).
The Godfather 89 
Incredible to Brilliant Direction, Great to Incredible Acting (Brilliant from Marlon Brando, Incredible from Al Pacino, Great to Incredible from James Caan, Great to Incredible from Robert Duvall, Great from Diane Keaton, Great from Talia Shire, Very Good to Great from the rest of the cast), Incredible to Brilliant Story (though its storytelling is a bit confusing), Brilliant Screenplay (Mixed with the nuances of subtly and symbolism), Great Score, Incredible Cinematography (uses Sound/Cinematography/Film Editing to really show the mood of the scenes and emotions of the characters), Incredible Sound (see Cinematography), Incredible Editing (See Cinematography), Plot Structure was good and unexpecting (considering I did not expect how the turns of the story went the way they did), Pacing was slow and steady; Runtime was log but it is hard to take out/cut any scenes because each scene feels like it is important to the story, The build to the climax was great with the final moments of the movie being amazing and full of symbolism, The Michael Corleone Story was incredible in showing how an outsider of the family could never escape the life made for him (even though he tried really hard to never be a part of it). Overall, and Incredible Movie that stands up to being 'One of the best movies ever made' as it is the definition of subtly and symbolism (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions) in a movie as Coppola delivers a magnum opus not only in his career but for the whole film industry (something that others have tried to learn from).
The Godfather Part II 147 
Incredible Direction, Great to Incredible Acting (Brilliant from Al Pacino, Great to Incredible from Robert Duvall, Great to Incredible from Diane Keaton, Great from Robert De Niro, Very Good to Great from the rest of the cast (A true masterclass in acting by the entire cast)), Great to Incredible Story (Sequel Part was Incredible to Brilliant and the Prequel part was Good and necessary (though I did not really care for it that much); storytelling was a bit confusing), Brilliant Screenplay (Mixed with the nuances of subtly, symbolism, and visual queues), Great Score, Incredible Cinematography (Uses Sound/Cinematography/Editing to really show the mood of the scenes and emotions of the characters; a real standout in how it uses the camera to look into the eyes of Michael), Incredible Sound (See Cinematography), Incredible Editing (See Cinematography), Plot Structure was good, Pacing was slow and steady; Runtime was long but it is hard to take out/cut any scenes because each scene feels like it is important to the story (Though it could be argued that many of the prequel scenes were not that necessary), The build to the climax was very good with the final moments of the movie being Incredible (especially last 7-10 minutes) and full of symbolism (especially how it mirrors yet differs from the original movie), The Michael Corleone story was Great (though not as good as the first) in showing how too far gone he is in his corruption and crime as he still have glimmers of hope of leaving (though he knows the dreams of being an outsider are too late to come true). Overall, a Great to Incredible Movie that stands up to being 'One of the best sequels ever made' as it is another definition of symbolism and visual queues (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions, especially Michael's eyes looking into characters) in a movie as Coppola offers a continuation of a story rather than a sequel.
The Godfather Part III 54 
Pretty Bad Direction, Bad Acting (Good from Al Pacino (Was either Great and typical Michael or Bad and overacting/disappointing), Good from Diane Keaton, Pretty Bad to Decent from Talia Shire, Pretty Bad to Decent from Andy García, Terrible from Sofia Coppola (One of the worst (if not the worst) performances in film history), Bad from the rest of the cast (Can clearly see how losing character from the previous movies effected this one)), Pretty Bad Story (The story of Michael's decline needed to be made and there were some good elements but the way they went about it really ruined his story arc; storytelling being a bit confusing)), Very Bad Screenplay (Extremely simple and Direct unlike its predecessors even though there are some elements of symbolism), Great Score, Bad Cinematography (The use of new technology and techniques in sound/cinematography really gave the feeling an off feel as it looks completely different from its predecessors (making it very weird when they cut back to footage from the previous movies but still keep its original quality)), Bad Sound (See Cinematography), Terrible Editing (The cut for this movie was extremely off and really jumped around too much in the story, which made it feel many details were lost (even though there were style choices similar to the past movies)), Plot Structure was bad, Pacing was slow and steady; Runtime was long but the cut they chose for the movie made it really hard to believe that more scenes needed to be cut as it could be argued more scenes needed to be added/rearranged, The build to the climax was very good as it mirrored the first movie but the actual ending was terrible and the choices the director made made zero sense (especially the final 15 minutes), The Michael Corleone Story was Bad (even though it could be argued it needed to be made, the route they went for his decline was just horrible and really ruined last act of his character). Overall, a bad movie that is a clear cash grab by using the Godfather name as it is a simple/dull movie that is horribly cut and contains many amateur elements, and while a third movie did need to be made it was clear that it was too late as the way this movie was presented makes it so distant from the previous two (making the audience start to see the downfall in Francis Ford Coppola's abilities).
Black Swan 60 
Incredible Direction (Only someone like Darren Aronofsky could have made this film), Good Acting (Incredible from Natalie Portman, Decent from Vincent Cassel (Hit or miss performance), Very Good from Mila Kunis, Good from Winona Ryder (Very Winona Ryder Performance), Good from the rest of the cast), Great to Incredible Story, Great Screenplay (A very simple yet complex screenplay (Simple in terms of the dialogue as it was very forced/unnatural and made no sense at times, while very complex in terms of the content/subject mater/symbolism in how it presents it)), Good Score (blended in very nicely and really liked how they used romantic/swan lake motifs), Great Cinematography (though nauseating at times), Great Editing (Great editing/visual effects in how it was molded together to show the hallucinations), Great Visual Effects (See Editing), Pacing was pretty fast fast/chaotic to mimic that of the mind of Nina (runtime was good (no need to add/cut scenes)), The build to the climax was great as you really do not know what is real and what is just made up in Nina's head (as she slowly drives into madness on her way to perfection), Incredible symbolism and parallel construction on how the obsession of the artist turned the white/innocent swan that Nina was into the dark/lost soul black swan she became at the end of the movie (something that is parallel to Swan Lake). Overall, a great movie that is both a simple, yet complex modern retelling of Swan Lake that looks into the obsession of an artist and how far one will go to pollute their innocence to become the best, even though it was told in a very simple, direct way.
The Fighter -2 
Good Direction, Good to Very Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Mark Wahlberg (Though pretty shallow in terms of his lack of depth in the more depressing scenes), Incredible from Christian Bale, Very Good to Great from Amy Adams, Great from Melissa Leo, Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story, Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (Pretty shallow and simple though, though it does have a good amount of comedic moments for a drama), Score was just there and didn't really do anything; soundtrack choices were very typical of that of early 2010s movies which made it a bit cringe, Great Cinematography (Especially how it gave it a very "documentary style" that mimics the beginning of the movie), Decent Editing, Pacing was pretty rushed as it skipped/merged a lot of events that actually happened when it really didn't; Runtime was ok but could have been a bit longer towards the end, the climax was very abrupt and pretty anticlimactic as the final fight and the reconciliation by the family is kinda felt as an after thought when it is meant to be the pinnacle of the movie. Overall, a good movie that is a fun watch that is driven by its performances but is held back a lot by it being a very simple retelling of what actually happened (even if some of the events were exaggerated).
Scarface 51 
Pretty Bad to Decent Direction (Good at moments (like the iconic ones), but pretty bad at others), Pretty Bad Acting (Good to Very Good from Al Pacino (Iconic performance (but its pretty one dimensional and his accent is horrible), Bad from the rest of the cast (most of the actors have a terrible cuban accent)), Good Story, Pretty Bad Screenplay (Has great/iconic moments (there are very iconic lines and moments but a lot of the dialogue/writing is very bland/direct)),  Very 80s Score (not that much of a fan tbh), Decent Sound, Decent Editing, Great Production Design, Plot Structure  was pretty good overall but it only talks about his rags and his riches (really misses out on the rags TO riches part), Runtime was pretty long but it is not used that well because it focuses too much on the ends of the story and not the middle, Build to the climax was good (mostly because it kinda just takes you there and is not a gradual build overall) with the climax being one of the best parts of the movie, The mood and vibe of the movies is extremely 80s (probably the most 80s movie I have ever seen), The character of Tony Montana is a great one that is a 'Rags to Riches to fallen from grace' character with iconic mannerisms (though he is not as great of a character as everyone makes him to be as he is pretty one-dimension/over-the-top even in moments where he shows his more sensitive side). Overall, a decent, fun watch with very iconic moments that is an embodiment of the 80s, but overall a very overrated movie that is not that well carried out as people make it to be (a true valley in its rags to riches story).
A Quiet Place 6 
Good Direction, Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Emily Blunt, Good to Very Good from John Krasinski, ), Good Story, Very Good Screenplay (Especially how it uses symbolism along with ASL to tell the story), Decent Score, Good Cinematography, Great Sound, Plot Structure was Good; Like how the movie ends on a cliff hanger to set up Part 2, Short runtime is used effectively as no scene is really unused and there really isn't anything that needs to be added/cut, Build to the climax was great with the final 20 minutes being a very great executed sequence. Overall, a well made horror film on the apocalypse trope that is a fun watch that keeps you on your seat, leaving you with wanting more by the time its over.
Zoolander -320 
Bumping up a few points for how quotable the jokes are and how dumb it really is
Interstellar 26 
Great to Incredible Direction, Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Matthew McConaughey (plays his stereotypical character), Pretty Good from Anne Hathaway (but pretty annoying at times), Good to Very Good from Jessica Chastain, Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story, Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (Symbolism and foreshadowing were carried out very effectively; even though a lot of the science was accurate, the ending was very convoluted), Brilliant Score (Hans Zimmers best work), Incredible to Brilliant Cinematography, Incredible Sound, Incredible Editing, Brilliant Visual Effects, Great Production Design, Pacing was pretty slow and dragged from the story at points; Runtime was very long to the point where past the 1 hour mark a lot of the movie seemed very dragging (About 30 minutes of the movie could be cut/rearranged and the product would have been better), The build to the climax (though very slow and steady) went along very well but the climax itself was extremely convoluted and really made the movie seem very pretentious, The resolution of the film was incredible and emotional as the final 5-10 minutes were some of the best parts of the film; The relationship between Cooper and his daughter was carried out very well as it is a driving force for many of the actions for the character as he has to weigh out his professional and personal obligations. Overall, a movie with brilliant moments and brilliant aspects that is dragged down by its extremely long runtime and slow pace; despite all of this, the movie was great as it explores the relationship between family and profession against the backdrop of a space exploration epic in one of Nolan's finest moments (even though he may falter at times).
Argo 55 
Great Direction, Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Ben Affleck (Though pretty one dimensional), Very Good from Bryan Cranston, Very Good from Alan Arkin, Very Good from John Goodman, Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Very Good Story (Though there is a lot of fabrication in what actually happened), Very Good to Great Screenplay, Good Score, Very Good Cinematography, Good to Very Good Sound, Great Editing, Good Production Design ((especially where they shot the movie to show the Middle East (though some of the shots seemed fake)), Pacing was a quick good pace (kinda mimics how quick the operation needed to be carried out); Runtime was good (nothing needed to be cut or added), Build to the Climax was extremely well done as it is a really anxious experience to see the hostages escape Iran with the overall escape being the best part of the movie (though it is extremely exaggerated in what actually happened), The resolution of the movie was good and shows the more personal side of Tony Mendez; the major flaw of this movie was how much of the story was actually fabricated from the true events of the Canadian Caper and Canada's involvement in the operation (which especially hurts given the 'based on a true story' tag it was as marketed/what was put in the film). Overall, a Very Good to Great Movie that details a fictional portrayed of the Canadian Caper operation and the rescuing of the Iranian Hostages, with the fabrication from the real story being one of main detractors from how good the movie is (especially cause it said it was 'based on a true story').
Pulp Fiction 116 
Great Direction, Very Good to Great Acting (Very Good to Great from John Travolta, Great to Incredible from Samuel L. Jackson, Very Good to Great from Uma Thurman, Good to Very Good from Harvey Keitel, Good to Very Good from Bruce Willis, Very Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (especially how it was set up as individual stories to mimic the "pulp" magazine style Tarantino was going for; also, the foreshadowing and how all the stories tie together was excellently pulled off), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (The prime example of Tarantino dialogue), Very Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Good subtle use of visual effects (gives the movie a very fictionally story feel)), Great Production Design (Helps give the movie the vibe it was going for), Pacing was good as it was quick and got the job done; Runtime was a bit on the longer side but the movie is broken up into multiple stories so it doesn't present too much of problem, There is no real apparent climax but the build to the last couple of scenes helps draw and put all the stories together (with the last monologue from Jackson showing his character development), Good use of music to substitute score (Helps with establishing the vibe/mood of the film); the movie is a bit shallow in terms of its meaning (though it does have prominent reoccurring symbols) but Tarantino was looking more to present stories that mimicked that of pulp magazines (cheap, graphic magazines that give you entertainment for a small fee)). Overall, a great movie that was a real trendsetter for movies to come after with this Tarantino-esque dialogue, action, violence, and storytelling, but it a bit overrated considering it was a major reason for better movies to come after.
Fight Club 18 
Very Good Direction, Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Good from Brad Pitt, Decent to Pretty Good from Edward Norton, Pretty Good from Helena Bonham Carter, ), Good Story, Pretty Good Screenplay (Though extremely meta and pretentious; a modern day interpretation of Catcher in the Rye), Decent Score, Good Cinematography, Great to Incredible Editing (Especially how it edits specific frames into the movie to mimic the editing style of 'Tyler' and allude to how the narrator may be having illusions), Very Bad Visual Effects (Looks extremely tacky and reeks of the Late 90s/early 00s style of forced CGI), Good to Very Good Production Design (Shows the dark, dirty world the narrator has gotten himself into), Pacing was good (constant quick pace which was helped by the movie starting at the end); Runtime was good (no need to cut or add any scenes), The build to the climax and epiphany was good with the final 15-20 minutes being executed very well (though I felt that there could have been 5 more minutes added to the end of the movie), The tone and narration of the movie was extremely annoying because it was told through the lens of a pretentious 'Holden Caulfield' who hates the world and leaves it to find himself (therefore being extremely meta in the process of telling the story), The actual twist (while I knew ahead of time) was very easy to spot as there were many plot/logical holes that could only be explained by the twist. Overall, a Pretty Good to Good movie that was very entertaining to watch the narrator devolve from a consumer lifestyle to a point where he loses himself in a modern day retelling of 'Catcher in the Rye' (Which is kinda a reason for why I did not like parts of the movie cause it was extremely annoying).
A Quiet Place Part II 56 
Great Direction, Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Emily Blunt, Very Good from Cillian Murphy, Good from Millicent Simmonds, Good from Noah Jupe, Good from John Krasinski, ), Good Story, Good Screenplay (Uses less ASL makes the movie a bit more 'Blunt,' but the movie uses plot points throughout the movie to tie the movie together), Decent to Pretty Good Score, Great Cinematography, Great to Incredible Sound, Plot Structure was Good, Short runtime is used effectively as no scene is really unused and there really isn't anything that needs to be added/cut, Build to the climax was great with the final 15 minutes being a very well executed sequence that kept me on the edge of my seat, The movie was scarier than the first (but uses more jump scares to achieve this); movie sort of ends on a cliff hanger but does have some closure to what will happen to the characters. Overall, a movie that is more of a direct continuation of the first as it uses a larger budget to make a better movie that is scarier, better executed, and a better watch overall (something I hope the spin-off builds on).
The Wrestler -32 
Great Direction, Pretty Good Acting (Incredible from Mickey Rourke, Very Good to Great from Marisa Tomei, Decent to Pretty Good from Evan Rachel Wood (Some moments were good and some moments were pretty bad), Decent from the rest of the cast (anywhere from pretty bad to pretty good)), Great Story (the plot develops into seeing how being past his prime has an effect on the Ram as he tries to escape loneliness), Very Good to Great Screenplay (With some moments being Incredible with the dialogue and symbolism and some moments being pretty iffy), Score use was subtle, Cinematography on a spectrum (nauseating a lot of the times, but the single camera action does help show the loneliness of the Ram), Great Editing (Used well to show how the Ram still views/hold onto his life as a wrestler even though he is well past his prime (best scene to show this was his walkup to working his first shift at the deli)), Pacing was good towards the ends of the movie but the third act out of 4 felt really slow and dragging at times; runtime was good (no need to add/cut scenes,maybe in that third act), The build to the climax was a full 180 and very sudden (not executed very well overall) but the actual climax of the movie was its best moment (climax/ending of the movie was incredible and extremely well done as you see how the Ram comes to terms with the choices he has made and the path he sets for himself (especially on how he views his relationships with his lover and his daughter/ his relationship with the fans), The character of the Ram was very well written as a lost soul who clings onto the highs of his life but instead dives deeper into the loneliness of humanity; very accurate representation of wrestling and wrestling technique. Overall, a Great to Incredible movie that shows the loneliness of clinging to the past and the eventual hole you can never get out of as we view the life of the Ram trying to come to terms with his life despite the best parts of his wrestling career being behind him (though the third act out of 4 was not as well executed as I would have liked it to be).
Leaving Las Vegas -88 
Decent Direction, Pretty Bad Acting (Very Good to Great from Nicolas Cage (In a Nic Cage Way; the most Nic Cage performance I have ever seen), Good from Elisabeth Shue (Dull in terms of execution of dialogue but very good in terms of actions and gestures), Bad from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (I like the way it flows and how the story is told from the perspective of the end), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was very poorly written but the actual actions the characters take were good; no major symbolism), Score/Songs were very Vegas-esque with this jazzy sound and not necessarily bad but were just way extremely overbearing in the film and took away from the story, Decent Cinematography (especially for it being super low budge), Terrible Sound (I did not like how overbearing the score/music was in the story and how it made it incredibly hard to hear the dialogue at times), Good Editing (I liked some of the metaphors it placed with the different cuts), Pacing was very bad and incredibly slow (the first 10-20 minutes of the movie were meant to be the prologue but was just way to long and slow in terms of developing the story and characters); the runtime was at just under 2 hours but definitely could have cut the movie by like 30 minutes to make the movie have a better pace and remove a lot of unnecessary scenes, The build to the climax was like not really there but kinda there (not executed that well overall), The relationship that the two leads have is decent and not bad but like its too formulaic and safe; Nic Cage's character is a decent character but was just way too Nic Cage in terms of its mannerisms and acting (you will know when you see it) but the portrayal of an suicidal alcoholic was not that bad;  the movie was completely formulaic overall (Scene of dialogue and action -> Overbearing Jazz score that pans to the either Vegas of the characters -> Songs with the same panning -> Fades to black to the next sequence). Overall, a bad movie as its only saving grace is to see the performance that won Nic Cage an Oscar (In the most Nic Cage way he could do it) and nothing else because the entire movie would have been awful if it was not for him as this low budget film really could not have been saved by the material (which was not that great to begin with).
Space Jam 1 
Pretty Bad Direction, Bad Acting (Decent from Michael Jordan, Pretty Good to Good from Wayne Knight, Great from Danny DeVito, Very Bad from the rest of the live acting cast; Great Voice Acting by the entire Looney Tunes cast), Good Story, Screenplay of two halves (Looney Tunes Parts were great and very similar to its traditional style, Real life parts were bad to pretty bad overall; there were some good references and jokes that I did appreciate (Mighty Ducks, Pulp Fiction, Patton, etc.)), Decent to Pretty Good Score (Liked how it incorporated Looney Tunes elements); Good Soundtrack, Pretty Good Cinematography (made it feel very animated), Decent Sound, Decent Editing, Pretty Good Animation and stitches with real life (especially for the time) as it gives it a pretty cartoony feel, Pacing was very fast and really rushed between plot elements; Runtime was very short (definitely could have used 15-20 minutes in the rising action as the film goes from exposition to the climax), Skips build to climax; the actual basketball game (climax) was executed very well as it was the best part of the movie and gives off a good message to the audience, The movie is pretty surface level but the majority of it is geared towards kids and people who wanted to see MJ so i give it a pass. Overall, a decent, fun watch that was geared mostly for kids as it was good to see how two icons (MJ in the NBA and Bugs Bunny in Looney Tunes) were able to come together to give off a lot of iconic moments with the battle with the monstars as the movie does not try to take itself too seriously.
Slumdog Millionaire 51 
Incredible to Brilliant Direction, Very Good Acting (Great from Dev Patel, Good from Freida Pinto, Great from Anil Kapoor, Great from Irrfan Khan, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Great from Kids, Good from adults, Decent from teenagers)), Incredible Story (A mix of bollywood with hollywood in a telling of 'Indian' Forrest Gump; also, the narrative and the story points molding together was extremely well done), Great to Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue during the non-romantic parts were incredible while the romantic parts were not as well done; the symbolism of how Jamal was able to use life experiences to be a true rags to riches was incredible), Great Score/Incredible Soundtrack, Great Cinematography, Good Sound, Incredible Editing, Great Production Design (shows the poorer parts of india (rest was also good)), Pacing was good but a bit inconsistent (slow during the childhood, extremely fast during the teenage years, decently fast during the adult years); runtime was a bit long but not terrible (probably could have cut out a few sequences), The build to the climax was incredible with the actual climax being extremely tense and modeling how bollywood climaxes are usually; the resolution was a bit poor in its execution and the movie could have ended with the climax (though the bollywood sequence at the end was a nice touch), The incredible nature of the movie is how the plot points throughout the movie connect at the end and during the competition (even though there aren't any deeper meanings in the movie); it is important to note that many of the elements of the movie is incredibly unlikely to happen (like people from the slums learning fluent English). Overall, a Great to Incredible Movie that shows some of the dangerous and true natures of India while highlighting some of its beauty as Danny Boyle pulls off an incredible rendition of 'Indian Forrest Gump' by loosely basing a story from the source material to show a bollywood rendition of the 'rags to riches' trope in what is an incredible watch.
Magnolia 10 
Very Good Direction, Very Good Acting (Incredible from Tom Cruise (Though he was literally just playing himself), Good to Very Good from Philip Baker Hall (), Very Good to Great from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Great from William H. Macy, Very Good to Great from Julianne Moore, Good to Very Good from John C. Reilly, Decent from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (I liked the way the store points ran parallel in narrative but intersected at many points throughout the movie; though, it does falter in the last 20-30 minutes), Good Screenplay (There is a lot of symbolism throughout the movie which I really enjoyed but the dialogue was just very basic, unnatural, and hard to watch), Good Score, Great Cinematography, Decent to Pretty Good Sound, Great Editing, The runtime of the movie is extremely long even with the 8 different stories (2-3 of the stories should have been cut to make a more polished product); the ending of the movie was very poor as it had to pick up the pieces from its very weird climax and only tied up the loose ends for like half of the stories (leaving the other half unfinished and questioning), Pacing was extremely slow (Especially dragging at some points) in the first half of the movie and extremely fast in the second half), The build to the climax was great and executed very nicely but the actual climax was a 180 from what it was building to and completely threw off the flow and experience of the movie (like I get why PTA did it but it still was just very poorly executed and threw off the movie for no reason), The conveying of tramua and emotions was pretty good and well executed as many of the characters are guilted and haunted by their pasts but at times it felt like the acting was a bit over the top (this also ties in with the use of the symbols as it explains these moments of trauma very well). Overall, a Pretty Good movie that has a lot of great moments and shows how the different characters lives intersect as they deal with their past trauma, but it falters from its inconsistent pace, terrible use of runtime (Given that it is extremely long and still does not manage to tie up loose ends), and very questionable ending (Something I see a lot from PTA).
Ferris Bueller's Day Off 15 
Good Direction, Pretty Good to Good Acting (Very Good from Matthew Broderick, Good from Alan Ruck, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (Pretty simplistic in its nature but contains very iconic scenes), Pretty Good Screenplay (Iconic Lines and Scenes throughout the movie with its breaking the fourth wall but the overall screenplay was pretty simple and bland (reeks of the 80s); little to no noticable symbolism), Very Good/Iconic Soundtrack, Pretty Good Cinematography, Good Film Editing, Pacing was a valley (very fast towards the beginning and ends but pretty slow in the middle); the runtime was on the shorter side but 20 minutes in the middle definitely could have been cut to produce the same movie, The build to the climax was a short spike that is very fast with the actual climax being an iconic sequence where Ferris tries to get back home; the ending of the movie was decent with everything coming back full circle (With the post credits being very funny and iconic, something groundbreaking for its day), The movie is kinda dry throughout but it is more of a film that is meant to watch and enjoy rather than dissect (though a lot of people give this movie more credit than it deserves). Overall, a Pretty Good movie that contains a lot of iconic moments and is a fun watch as we see the protagonist try to live some of his last moments of youth before growing up, but the movie is still pretty shallow with its content as it reeks of the 80s (especially with its subjects and meta storytelling).
Field of Dreams 64 
Pretty Good to Good Direction, Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good to Good from Kevin Costner (Kinda has the same expression throughout the movie (not bad but very static)), Good to Very Good from Amy Madigan, Good to Very Good from James Earl Jones, Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (Though a majority of the movie stems away from the actual subject of the film as the film takes about 40 minutes into a pointless side quest), Pretty Good Screenplay (Has iconic lines and good moments but the rest of the dialogue reeks of the 80s and is kinda bland), Great Score, Pretty Good Cinematography, Good Film Editing, Pacing was extremely fast in the beginning then pretty good in the middle and then pretty slow towards the end with a very abrupt ending (though the ending of the movie was decent to pretty good with everything coming back full circle (As all the points come to the purpose of Kevin Costner's character)), The build to the climax was very abrupt as you realize you missed the climax right as it is about to end; the runtime was on the shorter side but was very poorly used as there definitely could've been 10-20 minutes added towards the climax/resolution, The symbolism and themes throughout the movie are very romantic/hopeful as it makes you believe in a heavenly body experience as you romanticize about baseball. Overall, a Decent to Pretty Good movie that makes you root for the characters and gets very emotional at times as you go through a baseball themed adventure but is very overrated as the film does not use its runtime effectively and stems away from the subject/purpose of the movie.
The Suicide Squad 114 
Very Good Direction, Very Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Margot Robbie, Very Good to Great from Idris Elba, Very Good from Joel Kinnaman, Very Good to Great from Sylvester Stallone (Voice Acting, a little biased though), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good to Good Story (though a bit formulaic by combining pieces from the original movie and Guardians of the Galaxy; also, while I liked that there were misdirections/twists, I felt there were a bit too many by the end), Very Good to Great Screenplay (Very Tarantino-Esque as it is serious but is filled with great comedic dialogue to break tension; really liked how they used CGI/effects as a part of the storytelling), Decent Score/Good Soundtrack (Though the mix with old and new songs kinda clashed at times for me), Good Cinematography, Incredible Editing, Incredible Visual Effects (really liked how they used CGI as a part of the storytelling; liked the visual gore style cause it showed a blend of both cartoony yet realistic), Great Production Design, Pacing was good to very good (a bit quick at the end but nothing terrible), Build to the climax was very good with the overall climax being very well executed (bit long though); runtime was ok but 10-15 minutes of the movie could have been cut (especially at the end), the major flaws of the movie were that it was extremely formulaic as the storytelling was basically a carbon-copy of Guardians of the Galaxy (with it having a comedic relief character non-human who speaks few words and a ex-pro wrestler being the tough guy) with the story of the original Suicide Squad and the gore of Invincible. Overall, a very fun watch that makes me have confidence in the direction DC is going with their movies as this film has creative story telling, great characters, and great action sequences, even though it was very formulaic and a very similar/close-copy to Guardians of the Galaxy (which makes sense given its from James Gunn).
Sideways -10 
Great Direction, Great Acting (Incredible to Brilliant from Paul Giamatti (especially how he was able to embody someone with extreme anxiety and depression; Paul Giamatti is the focal point while all the others were great supporting elements to aspects of his character), Great from Thomas Haden Church (though it started out a bit rough), Very Good to Great from Virginia Madsen, Very Good from Sandra Oh, ), Great Story (A bit rough at first as the plot as the first 1/4, exposition of the movie was very dry in its details but the plot/story really begins to hit its stride and start running afterwards), Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue was both very conversational and elegant at times as it does a great job knowing when to shift from conversations to monologues throughout the movie (incorporating both the scholarly personality of Giamatti's character and the 'valley dude, player' in Haden Church's character)), Pretty Good Score, Decent Cinematography, Good to Very Good Editing, Pacing was a bit on the slower side throughout the whole movie (with the first 1/4 being extremely slow and the final 3/4 being a bit slow); Runtime was decent but could have been a bit more optimal if 10-15 minutes was cut from the beginning of the movie, There really was no build to the climax but the ending was very well done as Giamatti's character really comes to terms with who is and what he wants, the portrayals of mental health concepts (anxiety, loneliness, depression) are very well done as Paul Giamatti does an excellent job in portraying someone who struggles with these concepts as he tries to try one final push at life. Overall, a great movie that starts off very rough (a true slow burn), but it is an excellent portrayal of finding one's self as they deal with personal struggles as we get a snapshot of a friendship exploring wine country looking for love, something that could have really been polished if the exposition was a bit tighter (making the movie possibly a 9.4-9.5).
Halloween 6 
Good Direction, Pretty Good to Good Acting (Especially for the younger, inexperienced actors), Very Good/Iconic Story, Good Screenplay (Good use of suspense and no major flows in the dialogue), Very Good/Iconic Score, Very Good Cinematography (Really liked the POV shots and thought it overall very well executed especially with such a low budget), Good Sound (Good use of sound effects to help build suspense), Plot Structure was pretty poor as it felt that the first hour of the movie is the exposition and the final 30 minutes was the real horror and suspenseful parts of the movie (although the transition/build between these two parts was very well executed), Pacing was very slow overall as the entire movie felt it was dragging up until the final 30 minutes (there were moments where you could tell they were filling time, especially with the panning shots), Climax of the movie was very well executed as there was much suspense and misdirection that gave Halloween and Michael Myers their household names. Overall, a fun, iconic horror movie that made the most that it could from its very low budget by creating iconic moments and characters, even though it suffers from a poorly constructed plot structure that spends the first hour in dragging, exposition moments.
28 Days Later 57 
Good Direction (Some times were better than others cause it was a very raw experience overall), Good Acting (Very Good from Cillian Murphy, Very Good from Naomie Harris, Very Bad from Megan Burns (though a child actor so do not take seriously), Very Good from Brendan Gleeson, Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Good to Very Good Story (Though the inception of the idea of the virus is a very stupid idea), Good Screenplay, Good to Very Good Score, Very Good to Great Cinematography (presents a raw feeling of fear and desolation; though it does help play into the movie reeking of the early 00s), Very Bad Sound (inconsistent), Bad Editing (The jump cuts and style reeks of the early 00s), Very Bad Visual Effects (CGI/effects that reek of the early 00s), Plot Structure was good for the most part (first 5-10 minutes was very bad but rest of the exposition was fine, all other plot points were fine with the climax being good (though the actual storytelling in this part was chaotic), the ending was not necessarily bad but it was extremely safe), Pacing was a good steady pace, I liked how the movie had its tone set more to finding hope rather than living in fear, The horror elements of the movie were presented very well as there were suspenseful moments (even though it was not a majority of the film). Overall, a fun watch for a horror movie that makes you care more about the actual plot than the horror elements, even though the movie badly reeks of the early 00s.
Dune 0 
Good to Very Good Direction (Was able to manage the grand scenes very well and did a decent job with the interpersonal scenes), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Pretty Good from Timothée Chalamet, Pretty Bad to Decent from Rebecca Ferguson, Good from Oscar Isaac, Good from Josh Brolin, Good from Stellan Skarsgård, Good from Jason Momoa, Good from Javier Bardem, ), Bad Story (Bad Storytelling as the exposition does a very poor job of explaining the backstory), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay that is less awkward than most Sci-Fi movies but forces jargon that is not explained, Great Score, Great Cinematography, Great Sound, Good Editing (Though it made the movie more confusing when it cut between dreams and reality), Great Visual Effects, Good Production Design, Plot Structure very skewed because this is one part of a two part movie (First half is the exposition and second half is rising action), Pacing was Very Slow (The first half is incredibly slow while the second half is pretty slow), Climax for this movie is not that significant because it is meant to be a rise in the conflict for the next movie. Overall, a movie with great visuals and the presentations of a great space epic that acts as more of a prologue and beginning of a story than a full movie, though it does suffer from bad storytelling that makes the movie hard to follow; hopefully, this means that this part one sets up part two to be a better movie.
Psycho -3 
Great Direction (was able to manage the use of different angles and scenes to help tell and move the story forward), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Anthony Perkins, Very Good from Janet Leigh, Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story that is filled with twists and turns, Very Good Screenplay (uses allusions and symbols to help keep the audience guessing the mystery; also, the dialogue was very fitting for the time), Great/Iconic Score that helps with building suspense, Great Cinematography (especially the use of multiple camera angles and techniques to give illusions of fear and movement), Very Good to Great Editing that helps with transitioning between scenes and camera angles, Plot Structure was good as all points were laid out at the perfect time in the movie; the resolution (while iconic) was a bit convoluted for no reason, Pacing for the most part was good (although there were a lot of filler shots that could be cut into a quarter of the time just to fill space (like Norman cleaning or Marion's sister walking up the stairs)), The build to the climax was very well done with the actual climax being the most suspenseful and best part of the movie, the character of Norman Bates is incredibly written as it shows the effects isolation and jealously can have on an individual to descend into madness (with Perkins capturing this essence very well through his mannerisms and acting); the elements of horror as not necessarily the focal point of the movie as the film after the first hour is more a constant suspense rather than murders. Overall, a classic in the horror genre that lives up to the name as many iconic elements of the movie make Psycho a must watch for the slasher genre (especially considering how ahead of its time it was), even though it does have a good amount of filler elements.
American History X 49 
Good Direction (while a lot of the conversational moments with smaller character or extras was pretty bad, the more important moments and grand scale moments were carried out very well), Decent to Pretty Good Acting ( Incredible from Edward Norton (range of emotions, ferocity, and epiphany were carried out very well), Pretty Good from Edward Furlong (Good in some moments and Pretty bad and emotionless in others), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (Minor characters were Decent to Pretty Good, extras and very small characters were Pretty Bad)), Pretty Good to Good Story (Really liked the way the story was filtered between flashbacks in B&W and current in color, the fall and redemption of Vinyard was a bit formulaic, but the story towards the end really was carried out very well to show the message of the story), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (Symbols were a bit overt (though they were good in what they were trying to show) and the dialogue was very meta and forced), Pretty Good Score, Great to Incredible Cinematography (especially the way to show flashback being B&W (showing Vinyards past of separating color) with the present being in color (to show Vinyards future to look at multiple facets)), Great to Incredible Editing (helping with the cinematography), Plot Structure was good as it is a story that mixes past and present to move the story forward, Pacing was very good (nothing to really take out), The build to the climax was very good as the climax of the movie really shows the true nature of how life really is; it was the correct decision to end the movie at the climax as it really leaves the audience understanding how life really is, the character and arc of Derek Vinyard is fascinating as (though formulaic) as it shows the way influence has in corrupting the mind and it is only through self-exploration that real thoughts can be formed; the message of the film is very clear and a good way to end the movie as it shows how America is a nation filled with flaws from Racism though the beauty is try to overcome and learn from this (even though everyone is not ready to do so). Overall, a good watch to show the importance influence can have on corrupting the mind as we go through the story of Derek Vinyard (through an incredible and powerful performance from Edward Norton) to see how America is a nation filled with flaws and it is up to us to learn from and overcome these flaws (even though some may not be ready to do so), even though the movie may be meta and simple and representation in this message.
Dead Poets Society -7 
Good Direction, Good Acting (Incredible from Robin Williams (really tailored to his personality and was a good precursor to his role in Good Will Hunting), Good from Robert Sean Leonard, Good from Ethan Hawke (for what he was supposed to portray), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (the generic coming-of-age story in a conservative society), Very Good Screenplay (filled with many iconic quotes and is really carried out well by the cast (especially Robin Williams)), Pretty Good Score, Good Cinematography, Bad Sound (it makes it sounds extremely cartoony and unrealistic (especially in the spanking scenes)), Pretty Good Editing, Plot Structure was a bit off because the movie just ends at the climax (with no resolution or loose ends even close to being tied), Pacing was good (though there definitely needed to be 10-15 minutes added towards the end because of how abrupt the movie ends), The build to the climax was very well done because you begin to feel for Perry towards the end; the overall climax was fine but the movie just ends at the iconic scene (making it very hard to understand what happens to the characters because there are so many loose ends that are left untied), it is important to point out the plot holes in the movie (especially when Keating probably teaches other students, so like what happens to them; also in the iconic scene not everyone stands up and some of the people who stand up are not even in the Dead Poets Society);the development in all the characters (especially Ethan Hawke's character) makes you want to root for them towards the end; the portrayal of John Keating by Robin Williams needs to be highlighted more (even though it can be argued he was not really the main character (I would argue it is Ethan Hawke's character), he really steals the show with his iconic charm and comedy, but also shows his dramatic acting ability that prepped him for his career defining performance in Good Will Hunting). Overall, a coming of age drama that is a bit generic but is carried by Robin Williams' performance and iconic lines as you root for the characters in the end, even though the movie ends very abruptly.
American Beauty 22 
Great to Incredible Direction (Especially the ability to capture the symbols, illusions, and acting performances all at once), Great Acting (Brilliant from Kevin Spacey (Especially his ability to change moods very quickly and for him to display emotion through monotonous expressions (as if the character was written for Spacey to play, a true masterclass)), Incredible from Annette Bening (with her ability to capture dying beauty and someone who is trying to escape her mid-life crisis), Very Good from Mena Suvari (was able to convey someone who was trying so hard to escape from being ordinary by lying about who she really is), Good to Very Good from Wes Bentley, Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (in a modern retelling of Lolita), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (the dialogue was extremely conversational and used as a real tool to help convey emotions and the message, the symbols were omnipresent (especially the rose to display beauty and innocence) in helping convey the message), Good Score, Great Cinematography to show perspective, Great to Incredible Editing (helps separate reality from illusions), Great to Incredible Visual Effects (see Editing), Plot Structure was Great because you see how each character goes through development at each stage (especially Lester), Pacing was Very Good (no need to cut or add any scenes), Build to the climax was done very well because it is a gradual build throughout the entire movie; the climax itself was a carried out very well as you get to see Lester's real motivations in life and him being content for the first time in forever, Narration was a vital part (unlike its use in other movies) as it is used to drive the story forward (and not just tell it); the message of the movie (trying to fine beauty in a fractured suburban America) is effectively conveyed very well through the movie's themes and symbols (like the rose). Overall, an Incredible Movie that used the setting of a dying Suburban America to show the true beauty of America and finding self purpose when it may be too late, something that is effectively carried out in a career defining performance from Kevin Spacey and an Incredible Screenplay filled with many symbols.
Forrest Gump 2 
Great to Incredible Direction (The ability to go from scene to scene while keeping the narrative going was a highlight; also, did a great job in conversation scenes and showing the vast scenary), Very Good to Great Acting (Incredible to Brilliant from Tom Hanks (Has the charm and ability to play someone who holds heart (even though he may be slow), also his ability to use expressions to show emotion was also a highlight), Very Good from Robin Wright (though she really was the antagonist of the movie given how much struggle she makes Forrest go through at each stage of his life), Great from Gary Sinise (the ability to show trauma and overcoming it), Very Good to Great from Sally Field, Good from the rest of the cast), Brilliant Story (with how iconic each segment of Forrest's life makes him who he is and the storytelling from Tom Hanks to help drive the movie forward (and not just tell what is happening)), Incredible Screenplay (filled with iconic lines), Good Score/Good to Very Good use of Soundtrack (to help show which time period the story was in), Great Cinematography (especially its ability to show the vastness of many of the scenes), Good Sound, Great to Incredible Editing (especially its ability to go between different parts of the story), Pretty Good Visual Effects (Pretty Good use of CGI (though it was a bit over-the-top at times)), Plot Structure was incredibly unique as each segment in the first 3/4 of the movie were more used as vignettes into Forrest's life and the final quarter is meant more to show the present and show what Forrest's future will be (however, the overarching plot structure does a great job in still introducing character, introducing some conflict, and showing character development through passage of time), Pacing was good as the movie never felt like it was dragging even though it was a bit on the longer side (partly due to the nature of how the story is built with different episodes from Forrest's life), Build to the climax was kinda abrupt but the climax itself is the epiphany moment in Forrest's life in what his true purpose is (despite all that he has accomplished), the character of Forrest Gump is important to highlight as it is a true mainstay in American Society (cause even though he may not be the smartest, he had so much heart and love to where he could accomplish anything that was set in his path). Overall, an incredible movie that is one of the most fun watches anyone can ever have as the audience goes through the incredible adventure of Forrest Gump's life to see how much someone can do despite having so little (A true testament of the importance love and heart can have as a driving factor).
Goodfellas 6 
Incredible Direction (With the ability to handle such fast paced moments with a lot of moving parts at once and the conversations between characters), Great Acting (Very Good to Great from Robert Di Nero (though his character really does not have that much of a presence in relation to his billing for the movie), Great from Ray Liotta (was the right person to drive the story forward, just was not that amazing in the very emotional and sad parts), Incredible from Joe Pesci (in a very Joe Pesci way), Very Good to Great from Lorraine Bracco (though the interjections in narration from her character were not that great), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast (which is telling considering the number of characters in this movie)), Incredible Story (With Ray Liota's narration being an iconic feature for the movie in depicting the life of Henry Hill, though the final parts of the plot did drag on a bit), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (with the language being so fluid yet vulgar, the actions conveying the tone of the film, and the film being filled with iconic moments and lines), Incredible Cinematography (helped with setting the tone and keeping the pace going), Good Sound, Great to Incredible Editing, Plot Structure was good (though more time was spent in the first half introducing elements, the climax and the resolution dragged for a bit; the first half of the plot had a lot of elements displayed very fast while the second half had less elements and took longer that expected to explain them); I feel that the exposition and rising action were the real key points of the movie as that was what the most time was spent on and really shows the development of the characters, Pacing was very quick except towards the end (where the final 40 minutes really dragged on, and it probably could have been cut in half (still felt it dragged even though it was quick)), In my eyes there were 2 real climaxes for the movie (the build to the first one was great as they really laid out the suspense of its nature, the second climax (while not as big) was not developed that well); did not really like the ending because I felt it was very abrupt, Tone and mood of the movie is carried out so well by Martin Scorsese as this movie is a prime example of why this formula/movie genre works so well from him (in what might be his prime example for mob movies), Pretty Good score (despite not officially having one); Good soundtrack (helped set the tone of the movie); the key points of the movie that make it one of the most famous crime/mob movies is the characters that carry out incredible dialogue as it keeps the audience really hooked and care for the main three characters. Overall, a Great movie that is incredible for the first 3/4 as you get to see Martin Scorsese work in his natural element to create one of the mob movies that defined him as you go through the life of Henry Hill and his rise in crime, though the final 1/4 of the movie felt dragging and underdeveloped (leaving the audience not as satisfied as they were throughout the film earlier).
Dazed and Confused 10 
Pretty Good Direction (Good when handling the the overarching scenes but pretty bad when handling dialogue between characters (often leaving a sense of unintended awkwardness)), Pretty Bad Acting (Very Good from Matthew McConaughey (in his acting debut that set the tone for his entire celebrity persona), Good from Ben Affleck, Decent from the rest of the cast (ranged anywhere from pretty good to really bad (mainly due to most of them being very inexperienced and young))), Decent Story (chronicling the stereotypical summer before high school American experience in the 70s), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (while some moments were very questionable, the movie is filled with a lot of iconic lines (especially everything that McConaughey says)), Great Cinematography (especially to go between different characters and highlight elements of the night-life of the youth; also good in highlighting elements/actions of what the characters were doing), Decent Sound (though the paddle scenes sound a bit cartoonish), Good Editing, Pretty Good Production Design (helped capture the feeling of the 70s), Plot Structure was evident though there were some parts that were better than others (the exposition was incredibly boring and dragging, the rising action was the best part of the movie as that was where the iconic moments of the movie come, the climax (if you call it a climax) was alright as it was more a continuation of the rising action, and the resolution tied the lose ends pretty well), Pacing was two sided (the first 30 minutes of the movie were incredibly slow and boring as there was a lot of awkwardness and lack of emotion, the rest of the movie the pacing was fine and pretty steady overall), Build to the climax was not really evident as it was more a transition from one setting to another; the climax itself was not really evident as it was just a change in scenery (nothing suspenseful or super meaningful happened), No score in the movie; Good to Very Good Soundtrack that replaces the score (a lot of iconic songs from the time-period and is a key highlight of the movie); the movie itself was a hangout movie to soak in the aura of the 70s as the characters themselves are not that important (it is about seeing how they interact with each other and what they are into/listening to). Overall, a decent to pretty good movie that showcases the youth of the 70s in the movie that put Matthew McConaughey on the map, even though it may be a bit overrated and boring at many points.
House of Gucci 9 
Pretty Bad Direction (The tone throughout the movie was incredibly inconsistent, the acting as a whole was not properly conveyed (especially with the accents), and many scenes displayed a sense of awkward silence), Bad Acting (Very Good to Great from Lady Gaga (her mannerisms were very spot on, but some moments definitely shinned more than others), Good to Very Good from Adam Driver (Though his accent can get very annoying at times), Terrible from Jared Leto (Possibly one of the worst performances I have every seen, his accent is atrocious and he's comedic when his trying to be serious), Good from Jeremy Irons (his accent was the only believable one in the entire cast), Bad from Salma Hayek (Considering she is just using her Mexican Accent while playing an Italian character), Pretty Good to Good from Al Pacino (Has his iconic Al Pacino charm but there is still something off with his performance), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (though the cut spends way too much on the exposition and the rise of Patrizia Reggiani that the inevitable fall is kinda rushed and not well developed; the storytelling was decent though it was inconsistent on what elements mattered the most in presenting the story), Terrible Screenplay (while the symbolism is prevalent, the actual dialogue was filled with terrible jokes and forced sayings that made the conversations feel incredibly unnatural), Inconsistent Score (the score was used in moments it was needed and was absent in moments it was desperately needed; its absence helped set the inconsistent tone throughout the movie), Good Cinematography, Pretty Good to Good Editing (helped with some of the moments in the film), Good Production Design, Incredible Makeup (considering Jared Leto was unrecognizable), Good to Very Good Costumes (it was supposed to emulate Gucci after all), Plot Structure was prevalent but not effectively carried out (the movie spends too much time on the rise of the unrecognizable Partizia, that the downfall, climax, and resolution are completely rushed and feel like afterthoughts), Pacing felt like it was fine until you realize that there is 30 minutes left of the movie and the real conflict has only started to be introduced (this left the final act incredibly rushed), Build to the climax is present (but the audience is already disinterested in the movie at this point that it is kinda useless); the climax and actual key plot point of the movie is horribly conveyed as it is more comical than dramatic, Tone of the movie possibly is one of the major reasons the movie is held back as the movie does not know when to be serious or comedic and the lack of score and bad acting adds to the confusion of what importance most of these scenes have, The aura of the movie is present as it was good to see the 70s/80s/90s having an effect on the fashion and designs of Gucci and the soundtrack used to help show what time period the film is currently in. Overall, a very poorly executed movie that cannot be saved by performances from Lady Gaga and Adam Driver as the direction, screenplay, tone, and terrible acting make this movie extremely hard to watch and a mess overall.
