Overall, an interesting concept that is carried out well on a technical level, but this movie is held back by its monotonous performances and unnecessarily convoluted writing as it ultimately feels like if we had 'Inception' at home.

Good Direction (Incredible during action scenes and coordinating stunts and introducing scenes but poor during moments of conducting dialogue and the more personal scenes), decent acting (Very good from Robert Pattinson, Pretty good from John David Washington (Very emotionless in the first half though), Kenneth Branagh was pretty good to good but over-the-top at times, and the rest of the cast was bad to pretty bad), Great to Incredible Story and Idea (Though I think the middle chunk of the movie was kinda a waste, and the ideas were not executed that well), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was very stiff and not well executed to show what the ideas of the movie were), Great Cinematography, Incredible Score, Great to Incredible Effects, Bad Sound Mixing but Great Sound editing, Incredible Film Editing to coordinate backwards and forwards movement, The movie is very confusing in the first half but make more sense and come full circle once the halfway point is met, All the action scenes are incredible intense and pulled off very well in terms of the suspense they create (Especially the first scene and the climax), A movie that makes more sense the more you think about it, The pacing was way too fast and this played a major issue in presenting ideas and having dialogue cause it made things very unnatural and made things very confusing, A lot of the concepts on time did not make any sense and time travel is just a subject in film to stay away from overall (Even if you are Christopher Nolan). Overall, this was Christopher Nolan's worst movie (Hard for me to say it as it is) given the fact he is a seasoned director at this point and could not execute a movie of this magnitude off, but it is still a Good movie and would still recommend people to watch."
