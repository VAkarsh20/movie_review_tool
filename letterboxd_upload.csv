tt3748528,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,2016,4.0,2022-09-04,Good,"REDUX (09/04/2022)
Rating: 8.1
Overall, an entertaining movie that helps rejuvenate the Star Wars franchise through its well executed action scenes and fan-service to the original film, though it is filled with corny dialogue and introduction of too many new elements that it is not able to be on the same par as the original trilogy.

Final Third of the movie was amazing, great action, great plot, has a gradual progression from slow to fast pace, not a memorable cast due to the fact that they all die."

First Half extremely boring (Did not connect with story), Southern drawl makes it a turn off, Great Acting by all characters (movie only acting though), Viola Davis was incredible, Screenplay makes it only based on acting so might appeal to others who like plays and broadway."

Rating: 9.4
Overall, an incredibly funny movie that is incredibly quotable and a must watch for the jokes and the chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlburg as it is a pillar in the buddy cop genre that began to take over the early 2010s.

Movie comes around full circle, the shift in the middle explains for the uncomfortable and bad acting in the beginning of the movie, good acting, great story, natural but awkward screenplay, more of a thriller than horror movie, great last 3rd, Movie makes you feel very uncomfortable but the movie makes clear why it does this."

The movie is one of the most accurate depictions of war. Nolan brilliantly depicts the emotions of war with brilliant direction meshed with incredible cinematography, and a score that blends with the scenes. None of the bullshit with the writing or acting as it is stripped down to what it should be."

Overall, a must watch as Aronofsky puts himself on the mainstream map by crafting an incredible insight into the descent people go to fill the void of happiness they have as we get to see 4 characters spiral out of control through their addictions, though it is not a perfect movie as it is filled with many flaws (and but not it being it is nauseating and grotesque).

Take this review with a grain of salt cause I had to watch this movie at 3x the speed.

Very Poorly made documentary, Literally is just about like 5 people and where they were during the events, barely actually goes into the details of the events or the killer, does a bad job about talking about the aftermath, Very cringy lines and fake edgy from the interviewee and were just boring. Overall, this was a very boring documentary and the whole thing could be condensed down to 10 minutes and it would still be bad."

Great Acting (Especially Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt), Pacing was alright but not great, very enjoyable storyline, decent screenplay, Funny at times, Did not like the ending."
tt1979376,Toy Story 4,2019,4.5,2019-07-08,Great,"Rating: 9.3
An Unnecessary movie given Toy Story 3 but I am very happy they made this movie, Incredible Story, Incredible Screenplay, Typical Great Voice acting (Its Toy story after all), focuses too much on Woody and kinda relegates the importance of Buzz in his life as well as completely forgets Andy's old Toys and Jesse, Great Score, Beautiful animations and it can easily be seen the improvement in Pixar's animation skills, Great ending to the Woody Arc of Toy story."
tt8772262,Midsommar,2019,4.0,2019-07-08,Good,"Rating: 8.4
A great follow up to Hereditary for Ari Aster, Great Acting, Great Story, Great Screenplay, While it is not as layered nor does it have the depth of Hereditary it still does have a fair amount of layers and depth, Incredible Cinematography and visuals, Good pacing and the ending actually makes sense and is good (Unlike Hereditary), More grotesque than scary and there are scenes that are meant to be scary but are just funny instead, Good score, The perfect foil for Hereditary."

The Acting was Incredible by the Main Cast, The Production Direction was Incredible, The Cinematography was Incredible, The Direction was good, Very funny, Way too long of a movie, The movie does not have a plot, Its a wandering movie exploring the end of the Hollywood Golden Age, The ending was extremely confusing but makes sense the more you think about it."

Started off very poor in the first 1/2 and picked up in the second half, Ewan McGregor is still incredible, acting by Hayden and Natalie is Bad, acting by veteran actors is fine, screenplay is still bad, story is great, visuals are incredible, score is incredible, Most unimportant movie of the prequels."

Incredible Performance by Taren Egerton, Music was very well performed by the cast, Story was very good, Acting was good by the rest of the cast, Great celebration of Elton John's career and work, very funny when it needs to be and very serious when it needs to be, Time and continuity was not very good from the movie because there was not signs of when each event occurred or what year everything took place in, great costume design."

tt2527338,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,2019,2.0,2019-12-22,Bad,"Rating: 5.4
The entire movie is just JJ Abrams trying to correct the mistakes made by Rian Johnson, The first 2/3 of the movie as really bad and very cringe-worthy, the performances were very bland by all of the sequel trilogy characters, the screenplay was extremely repetitive and very boring, the story was just dumb and there are so many loose ends that will never be tied up, John Williams score so you know what it is, bad direction, Great Production Design, the pacing is fine because there is just zero expedition to tell anything that has happened before. The final third of the movie was pretty good, Very cringy movie overall."

tt6751668,Parasite,2019,5.0,2020-01-02,Incredible,"Rating: 9.5
Great Acting, Incredible Direction, Incredible Story, Incredible Screenplay (Both how Comedic it is and how trilling and powerful it is) even though it is in Korean and I was reading subtitles, Score was great in how it complements the movie, Incredible Symbolism in the commentary on Class Conflict, The Movie is broken into two separate parts (A comedic half and a thriller half), The pacing of the movie is very off because it spends too much time on the comedic side when a little bit more should be placed on the second half due to the commentary it is trying to convey, The issue with the pacing leads to the ending/epilogue to be very rushed, Overall Incredible Movie."

Very informative in the first 2/3 of the movie, great historical context and presentation, graphics and editing was very good for this part of the doc, general narrative was consistent and explained the message, final 1/3 of the movie just turned into anti-trump propaganda and a pro-hilary message, cuts were very biased at this point in the film. In the end very informative in the overall message of the film."

Incredible Acting by the entire case (Especially Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman), Great Screenplay, Good Story, Great Direction, Great Score, Incredible Cinematography, Very Surface level in terms of its meanings as I would like it to have gone a bit deeper in its symbolism and its criticisms of the cult, Lot of unnecessarily weird dialogue."

Decent Direction, Great Story, Good Screenplay on Average (Great to Incredible at some points and too meta to too angsty at others), Good Acting overall by the cast (Very believable and made me actually care about the characters, especially the main 3), Decent Cinematography, Good Symbolic shots, Pacing was very good for most of the movie but I felt the ending was a bit rushed as I would have liked to have seen another 20 minutes of it, Twist ending was good, Characters/emotions were very well written and the story and struggles makes it relatable to most of the audience being very emotional/crying at points because of how relatable the main characters struggles were, definitely one of the better coming of age stories told in recent times (And thats good considering how much I don't like these stories)."

Good Direction, Good Story, Decent Screenplay, Decent Score, Good Acting by the main 3 actors but the rest of the cast was pretty meh, The killing scenes were so hard to watch because of the bad acting, Good cinematography, Entertaining because of the story/subject but was kinda dry at times, The Pacing of this movie was not good cause of how it was split into two parts but the first part carried more weight than the second when it should've been the opposite, The exposition was too long and the resolution was too short."
tt0159097,The Virgin Suicides,1999,2.0,2020-06-17,Bad,"Rating: 5.1
Very Stupid Movie, Decent Acting, Bad Story, Bad Screenplay, Plot is pointless considering it sets up things that are just never revisited or solved, Narrative was inconsistent with its storytelling and structure, with the point of the movie to rationalize the suicides and the narrator saying he did not know it was pretty obvious to why they killed themselves, very boring overall in terms of the plot and story, inaccurate portrayal of mental illness, has Danny Devito though."

Very Funny, Great Acting by the main cast (Great Chemistry between all the members), Decent acting by supporting cast, Very Good Direction, Great Screenplay, Good Story, Great thematic elements of real world issues disguised in a Comedy, Good score, pacing felt very rushed and completely off because this movie was too short (I would have liked to see 15-20 more mins of the movie), The plot structure was way too focused on the final 40 minutes because of the shortness of the movie."

Decent Acting, The first hour of the movie was extremely boring, Decent story, Decent screenplay, Plot/conflict development was terrible as it does not go into why any of the supernatural is happening even though they allude to it begin a reason for Katie, final 15 mins of the movie were pretty scary but relied too much on jump scare tactics."

Good Direction (Great on a Macro scale of the entire shot but not so good on a micro scale when having dialogue between characters), Acting on a spectrum (Incredible by Jack Nicholson, Decent to Good by supporting cast, Decent from Danny Lloyd, and Very Bad from Shelley Duvall (Which in hindsight is a bad thing to say considering how much she was abused on set)), Incredible Story, Good Screenplay (Incredible use of Symbolism and Foreshadowing, good/iconic dialogue from Jack, pretty bad to decent for dialogue from other characters), Incredible Cinematography, Very poor Film Editing (Transitions were bad, a lot of continuity issues, poor/very stiff editing for shot/reverse shot conversations (Which the movie relies on heavily)), Incredible Production Design, Great Pacing as the building of suspense to the climax was incredible, Great to Incredible use of score and sound Editing to convey the mood and establish suspense, a lot of pointless shots in the film that did not add value to the plot. Overall, Jack Nicholson, the story, and the cinematography carry the film on a macro scale to make it a relevant piece of Cinema history to study, but the film fails to be Incredible due to the issues and problems on a micro scale."

Basically this movie was a test run for The Dark Knight as it used the feedback on what to improve on and did that incredibly (Making bad elements incredible and good elements Brilliant)."

Bad direction, Pretty good story, very bad screenplay, Acting was pretty bad overall (Only the elder characters were decent while everyone else was very bad), Pretty Bad score, Zero chemistry between the two leads which shows how there is barely any emotion from the flashback scenes, elderly couple shows decent chemistry and emotion which is a saving grace for the film (But like barely), the movie lays out as if there is going to be a twist but then spoils it midway through the movie which makes it very wasted, decent pacing, Movie was probably made by an angsty teen who wanted to get into NYU film school couldn't."

Great to Incredible direction, Great to Incredible Screenplay (Writing for Jake was incredible (Both in character writing and how they made his character's dialogue be from the perspective of someone who reads info from online), but other aspects of the writing were not on the same level), Incredible Story, Brilliant Acting from Jake Gyllenhaal (Best performance to not get nominated for Best Actor), Very good acting by two other leads, good acting by supporting cast, Pacing was incredible towards the beginning and end but the middle hour of the movie was bit slow at times, Incredible character writing for Lou Bloom, Great to incredible Cinematography and lighting, Pretty good to good Score, Good build of suspense (a very high intensity film as well) to the climax but kinda tapers off with the final dialogue between Riz Ahmed and Jake (Would have liked to just see it end with the opening line). Overall, a movie that is incredible from the perspective of Lou as he drives the film forward but is only great from that perspective as he is the glue for all the pieces coming together."

Great to Incredible direction, Great to Incredible Screenplay (Written and made as if it was taken from a documentary), Great Story (Concepts and overarching story is incredible but narrative direction and overall plot structure was kinda dragging at times), Incredible Acting by the cast overall (Nobody stands out as everyone acts as a key piece to the story), very good score, Pacing was a little bit slow and dragging at times towards the middle but not too bad overall, Some of the choices in terms of plot direction were kinda meh, Great to Incredible drama overall and one of the best movies on newspaper journalism, a movie that should be known for its scenes to be analyzed in isolation but not in how they all come together as each scene is worth its own merit but the overall scenes coming together does not keep to that same standard."

Good to Very Good direction (Especially when coordinating the heist scenes), Great acting by Ben Affleck, Great to Incredible Acting by Jeremy Renner, Very good acting by the rest of the cast, Decent Story (Good in terms of concepts but bad in terms of plot points, development, and story architecture), very good screenplay, Pacing was extremely fast and hard to follow plot points because of it, the exposition is very unorganized which makes it very confusing what is going on for like the first half of the movie, The final 45 minutes of the movie is great to incredible in terms of the suspense as it builds to the action that takes place, good cinematography, plot elements (resolution is very rushed, The climax is the best part of the movie as it is the most well structured, the rising action is also good as it helps develop the main character and him wanting to go clean, but the exposition, falling action, and resolution are not well executed which make the movie hard to follow and I was not that invested in the characters as we should be). Overall, what makes the movie is the acting by the cast, the action/intense scenes, and screenplay, but what makes the movie not great is the unorganized story arc and extremely fast pacing."

Extremely funny movie, Majority of the jokes hit hard and well but when they miss they miss pretty badly, Incredible Screenplay, Pretty Bad to Decent story (its a parody movie after all they can't really do much), decent acting overall by the cast, very iconic lines and jokes, decent direction, plot continuity makes no sense but I guess thats the point, actually uses its short runtime well surprisingly as the pacing as good. Overall, as a movie it is decent, but as a medium to display comedy it is incredible as it is way ahead of its time."
tt1285016,The Social Network,2010,5.0,2020-08-23,Incredible,"Rating: 9.5
Incredible Direction, Incredible Acting by the cast overall (Really enjoyed Andrew Garfield's performance more than Jesse Eisenberg's), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay, Incredible Story, Brilliant Score, Great Cinematography, Great Editing, The pacing is good for the first half but becomes very rushed in the second half (Feels fast but just mimics the nature of a startup) but the ending is very abrupt (Though that is how it is in the book it is based off of so I cannot fully fault), There is a build to a very abrupt ending that is kinda anticlimactic. Overall, Incredible representation of startup culture and college entrepreneurship overall as this movie will become a classic worth studying in the future."
tt0107048,Groundhog Day,1993,4.0,2020-08-23,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Funny to Very Funny movie (Especially Bill Murray), Iconic story, good screenplay, Movie is kinda about nothing but thats pretty much the point, the character development is shown but its kinda rushed towards the end against doing it throughout the movie, Good acting by the cast (very good by murray). Overall, classic comedy movie that is a great movie to watch on February 2nd"
tt1045658,Silver Linings Playbook,2012,4.5,2020-08-24,Great,"Rating: 9.1
Incredible Acting by the cast as a whole (Especially Bradley Cooper then Jennifer Lawrence then Robert De Niro), Great Screenplay, pretty good story, Great Direction, Great mix of both comedic and dramatic moments throughout the movie, Incredible displays of mental illness by the lead characters, great indian representation, The plot was very predictable and cliche towards the end. Overall, a movie that is carried by the performances of the main cast who have to carry such a heavy topic with a great script that is filled with cliches."
tt0088247,The Terminator,1984,3.0,2020-08-30,Decent,"Rating: 7.1
Acting on a spectrum (Arnold Schwarzenegger was good, Linda Hamilton was pretty good, Michael Biehn and some of the cops were decent but over-the-top at times, extras were very bad), Very Good/Iconic Story, Iconic lines (Which were perfected in the sequel) but very bad screenplay overall as the dialogue was very stiff/forced/not natural, Pretty good score (Sequel perfected the themes) as it gave a very 80s/retro futuristic feel and builds tension with the consent loud beating, Very Poor production design/visual effects when displaying the future, good makeup (Very good for Arnold), cinematography was pretty bad (Good for some scenes but very bad in others), action sequences were choreographed very well), Direction was on the spectrum (Good during moments of action and crisis but poor when directing other plot moments), good sound mixing, good pacing average (very good in terms of plot development but can be rushed or drag at times), climax was good in terms of action and suspense, The movie has a decent budget but looks like a student film at times. Overall, the movie is decent in terms of a watch but as a movie overall lacks in a lot of areas, but these areas are definitely improved upon and made better with the sequel as the budget/experience to make a better movie was there."
tt0381061,Casino Royale,2006,4.5,2020-09-09,Great,"Rating: 9.1
Very good Acting overall (Really liked the Acting from Daniel Craig, Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, and Judi Dench as I thought they were great), Great Direction, Great Screenplay (Both for its wit and its dialogue overall), Very Good story (Some Major plot jumps though that I was not a fan off), Action scenes were well choreographed, The pacing of the movie was fine but I felt that the movie was really rushed in the final 1/3 because it spent too much time on the first half development/exposition that the ending was very rushed and jumped around. Overall, a great exposition story for the origins of bond and set up a great bond portrayal by the best bond, Daniel Craig."
tt0079470,Monty Python's Life of Brian,1979,3.5,2020-09-09,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.9
Pretty Funny Movie (Some of the jokes were well thought out but some of them were pretty cheap imo but were still funny), Decent story and satire on Christianity and socialism, Funny acting by some of the characters, A movie that uses its short runtime very well as pacing is very good. Overall, a film that uses its R rating to have a lot of boundary pushing comedy, but one where the jokes are kinda cheap (Not a outright recommendation but still enjoyed watching it)."
tt6723592,Tenet,2020,4.0,2020-09-15,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Good Direction (Incredible during action scenes and coordinating stunts and introducing scenes but poor during moments of conducting dialogue and the more personal scenes), decent acting (Very good from Robert Pattinson, Pretty good from John David Washington (Very emotionless in the first half though), Kenneth Branagh was pretty good to good but over-the-top at times, and the rest of the cast was bad to pretty bad), Great to Incredible Story and Idea (Though I think the middle chunk of the movie was kinda a waste, and the ideas were not executed that well), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was very stiff and not well executed to show what the ideas of the movie were), Great Cinematography, Incredible Score, Great to Incredible Effects, Bad Sound Mixing but Great Sound editing, Incredible Film Editing to coordinate backwards and forwards movement, The movie is very confusing in the first half but make more sense and come full circle once the halfway point is met, All the action scenes are incredible intense and pulled off very well in terms of the suspense they create (Especially the first scene and the climax), A movie that makes more sense the more you think about it, The pacing was way too fast and this played a major issue in presenting ideas and having dialogue cause it made things very unnatural and made things very confusing, A lot of the concepts on time did not make any sense and time travel is just a subject in film to stay away from overall (Even if you are Christopher Nolan). Overall, this was Christopher Nolan's worst movie (Hard for me to say it as it is) given the fact he is a seasoned director at this point and could not execute a movie of this magnitude off, but it is still a Good movie and would still recommend people to watch."
tt9196192,Cuties,2020,0.0,2020-09-28,Terrible,"Rating: 1.9
Poor Direction, Very boring screenplay (From a translation perspective), the story had a decent idea but the plot points were very wtf and ultimately not necessary, very poor acting (Especially for the controversial scenes), The lack of score makes the movie extremely emotionless and the scenes seem very dull, The movie isn't as controversial as people are saying it is although the final 30 mins definitely could be argued against this because it was very cringe/hard to watch, It tries to show the evil in child sexualization but does it so poorly that it ultimately promotes it. Very bad movie overall and very boring to watch."
tt13143964,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,2020,4.0,2020-10-29,Good,"Rating: 8.0
Continuation of a beloved classic and one of, if not the, greatest comedies of all time. In its sequel, Borat does not have as much of the charm as its original movie did. Very funny at times but very mild or bland or disgusting at others, story was coherent as very politically brown nose against the right, the movie is ultimately propaganda to vote. Sacha Baron Cohen was great, though lost a step from her previous version, Maria Bakalova was good acting but was no where near the level of sidekick as Azamt, Good but safe story, Very good but safe screenplay, Good direction (But misleading editing). Overall, This movie was a good look back into one of the greatest movies of all time but plays it safe and ultimately boils down into a movie urging the audience to vote out the right (making it a very topical movie at the present but something that will not make it a classic like its predecessor). This movie really didn't have to be made and looks like a cash grab on a retired character."
tt11464826,The Social Dilemma,2020,3.0,2020-11-22,Decent,"Rating: 7.3
Great Topics that are complex but presented in a very simple manner that makes it easy to digest, Expert testimony of the documentary is very good as it brings in a lot of industry experience and credibility to persuade the audience to change how they view social media and technology, I felt they brushed on topics they should've discussed more (Like mental health), the skits were very poorly written and acted and they really drew away from the message of the documentary as they were very unrealistic, the message of the documentary was a little too pessimistic of what may actually happen. Overall, thought the ideas were very well presented, the skits and ending message really hold this documentary back from making a strong impact on the relationship between social media and society."
tt0116282,Fargo,1996,4.0,2020-11-22,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, the Coen brothers give a prime example of why they are some of the best screenwriters in Hollywood as they make a short runtime filled with many memorable, funny moments (even though it may not be as incredible as their other movies), but it does falter towards the end as it is incredibly rushed as it feels like it could've used 15 more minutes to keep up to the pace it had for the majority of the movie."
tt0066921,A Clockwork Orange,1971,4.5,2020-11-27,Great,"Rating: 9.2
Overall, a movie that is very hard to watch in the first 1/3 (both because of imagery, understanding the dialogue, plot, and pace), but once you get past that point, it is an great to incredible piece of art that shows the line between psychological treatment and free will as well as the ability for the redemption of the lost."
tt0101507,Boyz n the Hood,1991,4.0,2020-11-27,Very Good,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a Good movie to show the struggles of living in South Central LA and how those who dream to get out may not even get the chance."
tt0093058,Full Metal Jacket,1987,4.0,2020-12-23,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a good movie that shows the horrors of war and the effects it has on soldiers, but is very shallow in its meaning and message when compared to Kubrick's other films."
tt2582802,Whiplash,2014,5.0,2020-12-24,Brilliant,"Rating: 9.7
Overall, one of, if not the best, movies to show the obsession of an artist that wants to make it to the top, stopping at nothing to get there, as they are pushed past their mental breaking point to achieve their goal."
tt0415306,Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,2006,4.0,2020-12-26,Good,"Rating: 8.0
Overall, a fun movie to watch for leisure that has many jokes that hit very well and are very quotable, even though it may be stupid funny."
tt0319343,Elf,2003,4.0,2020-12-26,Very Good,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, an iconic christmas movie that is filled with many emotions, makes you root for the characters, and makes you remember the spirit of christmas, even though the movie is very safe, formulaic, cliche, and plays its cards very close to its chest (something I can't really blame given its a family Christmas movie)."
tt0085334,A Christmas Story,1983,3.0,2020-12-26,Decent,"Rating: 7.3
Overall, a movie that is kinda overrated, has not aged that well compared to other christmas movies, and has incredible pacing and length issues, but is still an entertaining watch for the family during Christmas time."
tt2948372,Soul,2020,4.5,2021-01-04,Great,"Rating: 9.2
Overall, a great Pixar movie (probably mid-tier) that is filled with incredible animation and thought-provoking themes, even though it has a predictable plot."
tt0198781,"Monsters, Inc.",2001,5.0,2021-01-09,Brilliant,"Rating: 9.7
Overall, the best Pixar movie (a little biased) that shows the loving dynamic of a father-daughter relationship through an animation filled adventure; lives up to how much I loved it as a kid and more, especially Mike Wazowski."
tt0407887,The Departed,2006,4.5,2021-01-14,Great,"Rating: 9.4
Overall, a movie that is a must watch, even with its small faults, as it uses Boston wit and humor laced into a story and screenplay to show the effects trauma and crime can have on people stuck in the rat race as the push through through what is ethical, in what is a Martin Scorsese masterpiece."
tt0083944,First Blood,1982,4.0,2021-01-14,Very Good,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a movie that is a fun action movie to watch as Sly gives off one of his iconic performances to create a signature character that is a war machine suffering from PTSD that is trying his best to just to live in a post-Vietnam, anti-war society."
tt0105236,Reservoir Dogs,1992,4.0,2021-01-19,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a ""Usual Suspects"" type film that is a good watch with good moments as the audience gets to see a sloppy, amateur filmmaker that is looking to make a name for himself (in what became a great launching point for one of the best filmmakers ever)."
tt0477348,No Country for Old Men,2007,4.5,2021-01-19,Great,"Rating: 9.4
Overall, a movie that is extremely metaphorical in nature about the world moving towards an evil that the old cannot adapt to that is filled with Iconic Dialogue, Great Action moments, and Incredible performances that make the movie a must watch that is incredibly true to the source material, even the though the pace is very slow and the tone is very dull."
tt0144084,American Psycho,2000,3.5,2021-01-24,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.5
Overall, a decent movie that shows moments of greatness from a future star (Bale and somewhat Leto) as the movie has good moments to watch (like the killing scenes and the overanalyzing from Bateman), but there are a lot of flaws in the movie that make it very hard to watch at times when looking at the greed of wall street from a very surface level, pretentious lense."
tt0265666,The Royal Tenenbaums,2001,4.0,2021-01-24,Good,"Rating: 8.1
Overall, a pretty good watch that shows how broken pieces of a family can still come together to make a single unit through adversity in what is a prime example of Wes Anderson filmmaking with its quirks and cinematography."
tt11032374,Demon Slayer: Mugen Train,2020,4.0,2021-04-26,Good,"Rating: 8.4
Overall, even though I do not watch the show/anime, I thought it was a good movie and is a nice visual/change of pace movie to watch to get people back into theaters."
tt1979320,Rush,2013,4.0,2021-05-11,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a good movie that I will compare a lot to Ford v. Ferrari where this movie had a better story and was more serious while the other movie is more of a fun watch with better technicals."
tt1345836,The Dark Knight Rises,2012,5.0,2021-05-11,Incredible,"Rating: 9.6
Overall, one of the best endings for a trilogy that ties a lot of the loose ends together and closes The Dark Knight story in an incredible fashion."
tt0387564,Saw,2004,2.5,2021-05-11,Pretty Bad,"Rating: 6.8
Overall, for a movie with such a low budget, the creators were able to develop the most from what they could as they created an iconic story line that is a mainstay in the horror franchise, even though it may not be the best in its presentation."
tt0070047,The Exorcist,1973,4.0,2021-05-13,Very Good,"Rating: 8.7
Overall, even though the movie does falter a lot in the development of its plot and pacing, The Exorcist is a groundbreaking movie in the horror genre (With its direction, screenplay, and acting) and stands up to be one of the most iconic movies not only in its genre but all time."
tt0335266,Lost in Translation,2003,2.5,2021-05-24,Pretty Bad,"Rating: 6.3
Overall, a movie that is pretty overrated as the movie is basically just shots of Japan that is mixed with good dialogue and scenes between Bill Murray and Scarjo, but in the end falters from its lack of story and very dull presentation (as it fails to capture to true aspects of loneliness)."
tt0264464,Catch Me If You Can,2002,4.5,2021-05-24,Great,"Rating: 9.2
Overall, a great film that is one of the most entertaining films to watch as it is a thrill of a ride to see all the different scams Frank Abagnale was able to pull off from the very start to the very end, something that really keeps you engaged at all times."
tt0942385,Tropic Thunder,2008,4.5,2021-05-26,Great,"Rating: 9.1
Overall, a movie that is iconic for its edgy humor and star studded cast that was able to mock and make fun of the oscars so much that they could build an oscar campaign for RDJ, and actually get him a nomination (something legendary in itself)."
tt0388795,Brokeback Mountain,2005,5.0,2021-05-27,Incredible,"Rating: 9.5
Overall, a very beautiful movie (both in scenery and acting/dialogue) that is one of the best depictions of falling in love I have ever seen, as the two lead male characters have to escape to a beautiful seclusion to show their true love for each other, something society won't let them do."
tt0327056,Mystic River,2003,4.5,2021-05-28,Great,"Rating: 9.4
Overall, a Great to Incredible movie that is one of the best presentations on the effects loss and trauma can have on people as the leads try to come to terms with what they have experienced, all symbolized in an very well carried out murder mystery."
tt0345950,The Spongebob Squarepants Movie,2004,5.0,2021-05-28,Brilliant,"Rating: 9.9
The embodiment and magnum opus of Spongebob Squarepants that has some of the happiest and saddest moments (You know the scene) witnessed during my childhood."
tt0470752,Ex Machina,2014,4.0,2021-05-30,Very Good,"Rating: 8.7
Overall, a film that is very visually pleasing (an artsy movie that actually pulls it off very nicely) and well made that makes society question AI and how cognizant we should make Automata (definitely one of the better portrayals of this phenomenon), even if the film blows it more out of proportion/exaggerates the extent/ideas behind it."
tt0167404,The Sixth Sense,1999,4.0,2021-05-30,Good,"Rating: 8.3
Overall, a pretty good movie (especially for horror) that has a lot of bright moments (like Haley Joel Osment) that put me on the edge of my seat and make the movie a horror classic (putting M.Night on the map), even though it falters a lot in terms of the plot holes and lackluster moments."
tt0780536,In Bruges,2008,4.0,2021-06-03,Very Good,"Rating: 8.9
Overall, a surprisingly very good to great comedy that mixes serious elements of purpose and grief very well with politically incorrect, hilarious dialogue as it goes through the lives of the two leads trying to come to terms with the actions of their past."
tt0111161,The Shawshank Redemption,1994,5.0,2021-06-05,Brilliant,"Rating: 9.7
Overall, an incredibly beautiful story on the effects prison has on men (especially innocent men) as they have to come to terms with their lives as they are stripped away from their freedom and have to continue to find hope even though the system keeps on trying to strip it away from them (something that makes you care for the subjects and makes you cheer and cry for them); moreover, the film is 1/3 of the trio of 1994 that is the embodiment of cinema before that year (given by the story telling and feel of the movie being from the 50s-60s)."
tt0068646,The Godfather,1972,5.0,2021-06-10,Incredible,"Rating: 9.6
Overall, and Incredible Movie that stands up to being 'One of the best movies ever made' as it is the definition of subtly and symbolism (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions) in a movie as Coppola delivers a magnum opus not only in his career but for the whole film industry (something that others have tried to learn from)."
tt0071562,The Godfather Part II,1974,4.5,2021-06-11,Great,"Rating: 9.4
Overall, a Great to Incredible Movie that stands up to being 'One of the best sequels ever made' as it is another definition of symbolism and visual queues (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions, especially Michael's eyes looking into characters) in a movie as Coppola offers a continuation of a story rather than a sequel."
tt0099674,The Godfather Part III,1990,2.0,2021-06-11,Bad,"Rating: 5.0
Overall, a bad movie that is a clear cash grab by using the Godfather name as it is a simple/dull movie that is horribly cut and contains many amateur elements, and while a third movie did need to be made it was clear that it was too late as the way this movie was presented makes it so distant from the previous two (making the audience start to see the downfall in Francis Ford Coppola's abilities)."
tt0947798,Black Swan,2010,4.5,2021-06-21,Great,"Rating: 9.1
Overall, a great movie that is both a simple, yet complex modern retelling of Swan Lake that looks into the obsession of an artist and how far one will go to pollute their innocence to become the best, even though it was told in a very simple, direct way."
tt0964517,The Fighter,2010,4.0,2021-06-21,Very Good,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a good movie that is a fun watch that is driven by its performances but is held back a lot by it being a very simple retelling of what actually happened (even if some of the events were exaggerated)."
tt0086250,Scarface,1983,3.5,2021-07-01,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.6
Overall, a decent, fun watch with very iconic moments that is an embodiment of the 80s, but overall a very overrated movie that is not that well carried out as people make it to be (a true valley in its rags to riches story)."
tt6644200,A Quiet Place,2018,4.0,2021-07-03,Very Good,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a well made horror film on the apocalypse trope that is a fun watch that keeps you on your seat, leaving you with wanting more by the time its over."

Bumping up a few points for how quotable the jokes are and how dumb it really is.

ORIGINAL (07/03/2021)
Rating: 7.1
Decent Direction, Pretty Funny acting (Though very stupid), Decent story, Pretty Funny movie (Even though its so dumb why its funny), Runtime was short but every minute was used effectively (nothing needed to be added/cut). Overall, a pretty funny movie overall even though it was incredibly stupid."
tt0816692,Interstellar,2014,4.5,2021-07-05,Great,"Rating: 9.1
Overall, a movie with brilliant moments and brilliant aspects that is dragged down by its extremely long runtime and slow pace; despite all of this, the movie was great as it explores the relationship between family and profession against the backdrop of a space exploration epic in one of Nolan's finest moments (even though he may falter at times)."
tt1024648,Argo,2012,4.5,2021-07-11,Great,"Rating: 9.0
Overall, a Very Good to Great Movie that details a fictional portrayed of the Canadian Caper operation and the rescuing of the Iranian Hostages, with the fabrication from the real story being one of main detractors from how good the movie is (especially cause it said it was 'based on a true story')."
tt0110912,Pulp Fiction,1994,4.5,2021-07-11,Great,"Rating: 9.3
Overall, a great movie that was a real trendsetter for movies to come after with this Tarantino-esque dialogue, action, violence, and storytelling, but it a bit overrated considering it was a major reason for better movies to come after."
tt0137523,Fight Club,1999,4.0,2021-07-19,Good,"Rating: 8.1
Overall, a Pretty Good to Good movie that was very entertaining to watch the narrator devolve from a consumer lifestyle to a point where he loses himself in a modern day retelling of 'Catcher in the Rye' (Which is kinda a reason for why I did not like parts of the movie cause it was extremely annoying)."
tt8332922,A Quiet Place Part II,2020,4.0,2021-07-22,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a movie that is more of a direct continuation of the first as it uses a larger budget to make a better movie that is scarier, better executed, and a better watch overall (something I hope the spin-off builds on)."
tt1125849,The Wrestler,2008,4.5,2021-07-24,Great,"Rating: 9.3
Overall, a Great to Incredible movie that shows the loneliness of clinging to the past and the eventual hole you can never get out of as we view the life of the Ram trying to come to terms with his life despite the best parts of his wrestling career being behind him (though the third act out of 4 was not as well executed as I would have liked it to be)."
tt0113627,Leaving Las Vegas,1995,1.5,2021-07-25,Bad,"Rating: 4.9
Overall, a bad movie as its only saving grace is to see the performance that won Nic Cage an Oscar (In the most Nic Cage way he could do it) and nothing else because the entire movie would have been awful if it was not for him as this low budget film really could not have been saved by the material (which was not that great to begin with)."
tt0117705,Space Jam,1996,3.0,2021-07-28,Decent,"Rating: 7.2
Overall, a decent, fun watch that was geared mostly for kids as it was good to see how two icons (MJ in the NBA and Bugs Bunny in Looney Tunes) were able to come together to give off a lot of iconic moments with the battle with the monstars as the movie does not try to take itself too seriously."
tt1010048,Slumdog Millionaire,2008,4.5,2021-08-01,Great,"Rating: 9.4
Overall, a Great to Incredible Movie that shows some of the dangerous and true natures of India while highlighting some of its beauty as Danny Boyle pulls off an incredible rendition of 'Indian Forrest Gump' by loosely basing a story from the source material to show a bollywood rendition of the 'rags to riches' trope in what is an incredible watch."
tt0175880,Magnolia,1999,3.5,2021-08-09,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.9
Overall, a Pretty Good movie that has a lot of great moments and shows how the different characters lives intersect as they deal with their past trauma, but it falters from its inconsistent pace, terrible use of runtime (Given that it is extremely long and still does not manage to tie up loose ends), and very questionable ending (Something I see a lot from PTA)."
tt0091042,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,1986,4.0,2021-08-16,Good,"Rating: 8.0
Overall, a Pretty Good movie that contains a lot of iconic moments and is a fun watch as we see the protagonist try to live some of his last moments of youth before growing up, but the movie is still pretty shallow with its content as it reeks of the 80s (especially with its subjects and meta storytelling)."
tt0097351,Field of Dreams,1989,3.5,2021-08-16,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.8
Overall, a Decent to Pretty Good movie that makes you root for the characters and gets very emotional at times as you go through a baseball themed adventure but is very overrated as the film does not use its runtime effectively and stems away from the subject/purpose of the movie."
tt6334354,The Suicide Squad,2021,4.0,2021-08-24,Very Good,"Rating: 8.7
Overall, a very fun watch that makes me have confidence in the direction DC is going with their movies as this film has creative story telling, great characters, and great action sequences, even though it was very formulaic and a very similar/close-copy to Guardians of the Galaxy (which makes sense given its from James Gunn)."
tt0375063,Sideways,2004,4.5,2021-08-27,Great,"Rating: 9.1
Overall, a great movie that starts off very rough (a true slow burn), but it is an excellent portrayal of finding one's self as they deal with personal struggles as we get a snapshot of a friendship exploring wine country looking for love, something that could have really been polished if the exposition was a bit tighter (making the movie possibly a 9.4-9.5)."
tt0077651,Halloween,1978,4.0,2021-10-21,Good,"Rating: 8.1
Overall, a fun, iconic horror movie that made the most that it could from its very low budget by creating iconic moments and characters, even though it suffers from a poorly constructed plot structure that spends the first hour in dragging, exposition moments."
tt0289043,28 Days Later,2002,4.0,2021-10-27,Good,"Rating: 8.0
Overall, a fun watch for a horror movie that makes you care more about the actual plot than the horror elements, even though the movie badly reeks of the early 00s."
tt1160419,Dune,2021,4.0,2021-10-31,Good,"Rating: 8.0
Overall, a movie with great visuals and the presentations of a great space epic that acts as more of a prologue and beginning of a story than a full movie, though it does suffer from bad storytelling that makes the movie hard to follow; hopefully, this means that this part one sets up part two to be a better movie."
tt0054215,Psycho,1960,4.5,2021-11-08,Great,"Rating: 9.1
Overall, a classic in the horror genre that lives up to the name as many iconic elements of the movie make Psycho a must watch for the slasher genre (especially considering how ahead of its time it was), even though it does have a good amount of filler elements."
tt0120586,American History X,1998,4.0,2021-11-09,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a good watch to show the importance influence can have on corrupting the mind as we go through the story of Derek Vinyard (through an incredible and powerful performance from Edward Norton) to see how America is a nation filled with flaws and it is up to us to learn from and overcome these flaws (even though some may not be ready to do so), even though the movie may be meta and simple and representation in this message."
tt0097165,Dead Poets Society,1989,4.0,2021-11-10,Very Good,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a coming of age drama that is a bit generic but is carried by Robin Williams' performance and iconic lines as you root for the characters in the end, even though the movie ends very abruptly."
tt0169547,American Beauty,1999,5.0,2021-11-17,Incredible,"Rating: 9.5
Overall, an Incredible Movie that used the setting of a dying Suburban America to show the true beauty of America and finding self purpose when it may be too late, something that is effectively carried out in a career defining performance from Kevin Spacey and an Incredible Screenplay filled with many symbols."
tt0109830,Forrest Gump,1994,5.0,2021-11-22,Incredible,"Rating: 9.6
Overall, an incredible movie that is one of the most fun watches anyone can ever have as the audience goes through the incredible adventure of Forrest Gump's life to see how much someone can do despite having so little (A true testament of the importance love and heart can have as a driving factor)."
tt0099685,Goodfellas,1990,4.5,2021-11-23,Great,"Rating: 9.3
Overall, a Great movie that is incredible for the first 3/4 as you get to see Martin Scorsese work in his natural element to create one of the mob movies that defined him as you go through the life of Henry Hill and his rise in crime, though the final 1/4 of the movie felt dragging and underdeveloped (leaving the audience not as satisfied as they were throughout the film earlier)."
tt0106677,Dazed and Confused,1993,3.0,2021-11-24,Decent,"Rating: 7.3
Overall, a decent to pretty good movie that showcases the youth of the 70s in the movie that put Matthew McConaughey on the map, even though it may be a bit overrated and boring at many points."
tt11214590,House of Gucci,2021,1.5,2021-11-30,Bad,"Rating: 4.6
Overall, a very poorly executed movie that cannot be saved by performances from Lady Gaga and Adam Driver as the direction, screenplay, tone, and terrible acting make this movie extremely hard to watch and a mess overall."
tt0467406,Juno,2007,3.5,2021-12-01,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.5
Overall, a decent to pretty good movie that was a generic coming-of-age story that was masked with the backdrop of the teenage pregnancy and annoying, angsty moments."
tt10872600,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,4.5,2021-12-23,Great,"Rating: 9.3
Overall, a defining comic-book movie that is filled with action, humor, and sadness as we get to see some familiar faces get second chances and get the closure they never got with both their characters and their careers."
tt0099785,Home Alone,1990,4.0,2021-12-25,Very Good,"Rating: 8.9
Overall, one of the best christmas movies ever made as we get to see the iconic elements carried out by Culkin and the wet bandits as they navigate through the different traps and high jinks, and I would rate this movie higher but I personally prefer the sequel more due to personal reasons."
tt3581652,West Side Story,2021,4.5,2021-12-25,Great,"Rating: 9.1
Overall, a great remake of the original as we get to hear and see new faces, and old, carry out iconic characters and numbers as this new rendition pays homage to the original in may ways while also holding its own as it brings back the flair and numbers that make West Side Story one of the most well-known musicals of all time."
tt0038650,It's a Wonderful Life,1946,4.0,2021-12-30,Very Good,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a good watch that stands the test of time as we get to see George Bailey find out the true importance of life and how valuable it really is in this Christmas classic, even though it falters in its plot structure taking away from its best elements."
tt0396269,Wedding Crashers,2005,3.5,2021-12-31,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.7
Overall, a fun movie to watch that is filled with many memorable quotes and good laughs, but what holds the movie back is it reeking of the 00s Rom-Com archetype with its predictable story and constant cliches, so it would probably be a fun movie to watch in the background or picking it up in the middle on TV."
tt10366460,CODA,2021,4.0,2021-01-01,Very Good,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a good movie that is carried by the strong performances of the entire cast as we get to see a rare insight into deaf culture, though the movie is held back by it playing way too much to the coming-of-age genre through its cliches and predictable plot."
tt8721424,"Tick, Tick... Boom!",2021,4.0,2022-01-06,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a movie carried by Andrew Garfield as he transforms himself into Jonathan Larson as he tells the story of building a legacy and to keep on going (even if you never get to see your success), though it held back by some of its numbers, limited acting/direction, and very bad CGI."
tt11286314,Don't Look Up,2021,3.5,2022-01-06,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.8
Overall, it is great to see Adam McKay play more to his roots at not taking himself too seriously as he creates a funny comedy that has some real highlights, though he still has a big mess on his hands from a pretty poorly structured plot and forced political message that is not told well."
tt11271038,Licorice Pizza,2021,4.5,2022-01-11,Great,"Rating: 9.2
Overall, a great movie and a very fun watch as we get to see these young characters grow through the different adventures they go on as PT Anderson delivers a great hangout movie that shows why he is one of the most respected filmmakers in the business by getting the most out of his script and elevating very new actors."
tt7888964,Nobody,2021,3.0,2022-03-01,Decent,"Rating: 7.3
Overall, a decent watch that was filled with action, though it entirely feels like a John Wick copy (which makes sense given who made the movie)."
tt12789558,Belfast,2021,3.5,2022-03-01,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.8
Overall, a pretty good movie that is filled with many highlights in direction and acting but feels pretty boring as the plot is very minimal and has nothing memorable to go off of."
tt1877830,The Batman,2022,4.0,2022-03-12,Good,"Rating: 8.1
Overall, a movie that has the potential to set up a good new Batman film series but suffers from a lot of flaws in its first encounter; it will be interesting to see where we are taken next as we follow this new, darker version of Batman."
tt7740496,Nightmare Alley,2021,4.0,2022-03-15,Very Good,"Rating: 8.7
Overall, Good to Very Good movie that is visually appealing as we go through the mystery of the characters that was a fun and captivating watch, though it is a bit surface level in both its formulaic plot structure and story leaving us wanting more as it feels like nothing really happens."
tt1245492,This is the End,2013,4.5,2022-03-16,Great,"Rating: 9.2
Overall, an incredibly funny movie that is a masterclass in improv from some of the most prominent comedic actors of the early 2010s as we got to see how well they work with each other to make a very disastrous, fun scenario."
tt9620288,King Richard,2021,4.0,2022-03-21,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a movie that is fueled by the best performance that Will Smith has ever given as he transforms himself into a compassionate father that wants his daughters to succeed, though it does falter from its feel-good tone and its revisionist history given that it is told from the Williams' family perspective (though it gets a lot of small details right which I do applaud)."
tt2382320,No Time to Die,2021,4.0,2022-03-25,Good,"Rating: 8.4
Overall, a nice conclusion to Daniel Craig as James Bond as we get to see him close out the character on his own terms in a very action packed, emotional manner, but the movie does not really compete with his other movies like Skyfall and Casino Royale due to the subpar screenplay/story and questionable performances from Rami Malek and some of the minor characters."
tt14039582,Drive My Car,2021,4.0,2022-03-27,Very Good,"Rating: 8.8
Overall, a very well made and written movie that looks at the effects of holding on to trauma and the importance of letting go as we see all the characters be parts of a well oiled machine, but where the movie really fails with its extremely long runtime and mismanaged plot structure as it really feels like the movie is dragging a lot (something the viewer has to get past to see the hidden beauty)."
tt10293406,The Power of the Dog,2021,4.0,2022-04-06,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a movie that is very artistic in its use of subtly and production design as we follow a cowboy come to terms with his own identity, but even though the movie is well made, it falters from relying too much on subtly and ultimately leaves the audience with more questions in the end."
tt0071315,Chinatown,1974,4.5,2022-04-11,Great,"Rating: 9.2
Overall, a classic that still holds up very well as a very well written story mixed with some of the best talent of the time makes the movie a film noir that is very similar to the time in its presentation but very different in how it lays the plot together and how things finish off (though it does falter a bit in its plot structure and pacing of different elements)."
tt0110413,Léon: The Professional,1994,2.5,2022-04-19,Pretty Bad,"Rating: 6.8
Overall, an action movie with a lot of action sequences that were carried out nicely and had good moments, but lacks a well structured plot and screenplay that could not save the themes and relationships they were trying to portray."
tt0033467,Citizen Kane,1941,4.5,2022-04-27,Great,"Rating: 9.4
Overall, A revolutionary film that still holds up since it premiered as it incorporated many groundbreaking elements that are used by films to come as Orson Welles defines a new generation of filmmaking, even though it did run very fast to the point were it was hard to pay attention to what was going on."
tt0181875,Almost Famous,2000,4.0,2022-04-29,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a well written movie that was a fun watch with some good performances but plays a little too safe and kinda falls apart towards the end."
tt0121766,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,2005,5.0,2022-05-11,Incredible,"Rating: 9.5
Overall, An incredible story with the technical achievements that really make this movie a must watch and a favorite of mine as it helps bridge the prequels with the original trilogy, even though it does reek of the bad dialogue and direction that the rest of the prequels suffer from."
tt9419884,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2022,3.0,2022-05-23,Decent,"Rating: 7.0
Overall, a highly anticipated Marvel movie that plays too strongly to its predecessors as it is very formulaic in the MCU boilerplate and has pretty poor writing overall, but has some highlights when it comes to acting, direction, visuals, and new stylistic choices that make it a bit different from other MCU movies (even though by not a lot)."
tt11138512,The Northman,2022,4.0,2022-05-24,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a epic that is a good watch filled with many good performances, great cinematography, and well carried out action scenes, but is still simplistic given the plot and how cliche/predictable it got at times."
tt0076666,Saturday Night Fever,1977,3.0,2022-05-30,Decent,"Rating: 7.1
Overall, a movie with highlights in John Travolta's performance, soundtrack, and dancing sequences, but really has some misses in other aspects as it misses the mark in terms of its writing and other performances."
tt0120737,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,2001,4.5,2022-05-30,Great,"Rating: 9.3
Overall, a great introduction into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy as the execution and different parts are well done to start this epic story off as the audience is left wanting more from the characters and the story as they transition into the next part."
tt0092099,Top Gun,1986,3.5,2022-06-03,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.6
Overall, an iconic movie that is a fun watch but really does reek of the 80s with its writing and acting as the audience has to get past the pretty simple plot to see the moments that make Top Gun a famous movie for its time."
tt1745960,Top Gun: Maverick,2022,4.5,2022-06-04,Great,"Rating: 9.2
Overall, a great action movie that is far better than the original as it builds off of the first movie very well through its well executed action/fighter pilot scenes and improved personal scenes, making this legacy sequel a must watch to relive old memories created from the original movie."
tt5108870,Morbius,2022,0.0,2022-06-07,Terrible,"Rating: 1.0
Overall, one of the worst movies ever created with how much money was put into this and the output they got as there is not a single good thing to say about this movie (and I really hope nobody has to go through the struggle of having to see it, even for the meme)."
tt0076759,Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope,1977,5.0,2022-06-12,Incredible,"Rating: 9.5
Overall, an important movie to watch in what created one of the most iconic franchises in the world and helped jump-start a story that is beloved by many through its technical achieves and story-writing, even though the direction is a bit lacking."
tt0061722,The Graduate,1967,4.0,2022-06-14,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a movie that is a very good watch and has things to watch for (like direction and acting) as we get to see Dustin Hoffman enter the Hollywood scene with a very comedic movie that is groundbreaking in the rom-com genre, but the film suffers from a very imbalanced plot structure as it favors the Mrs.Robinson relationship a lot more than it should."
tt1636826,Project X,2012,2.0,2022-06-17,Bad,"Rating: 5.3
Overall, an impactful movie for its time that is shot very well but is so poorly written that it is really hard to watch at times, and the movie is a copy of Superbad and it really shows."
tt0120815,Saving Private Ryan,1998,5.0,2022-06-28,Incredible,"Rating: 9.5
Overall, and incredible movie that is a must watch to see the effects trauma has on soldiers of war who want to get out but cannot due to the duty they have to serve to their country."
tt2084970,The Imitation Game,2014,4.0,2022-06-28,Very Good,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a good movie that presents an important story in history (Alan Turing) and is carried by an incredible performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, but is pretty simplistic in execution and drags a bit towards the end."
tt0073195,Jaws,1975,4.0,2022-06-28,Good,"Rating: 8.1
Overall, a groundbreaking film for its technical achievements and different elements, but is pretty simplistic in terms of writing and plot-based elements."
tt0167261,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,2002,4.0,2022-06-28,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a movie that is more about building the story in the trilogy rather than being experienced on its own with it more concerned about transitioning to the next part to see how the trilogy concludes (which makes it not hit the mark as well as the previous one)."
tt6343314,Creed II,2018,3.5,2022-07-03,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.8
Overall, a movie that is a good conclusion to Rocky's story line and has really good moments when it comes to his and the legacy characters, but is really held back by the Creed core in terms of the depth they can really go."
tt1723121,We're the Millers,2013,3.5,2022-07-03,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.7
Overall, a funny movie with good performances that is a fun watch that is not very serious, though the flawed characters growing from their journey is a nice touch."
tt0080684,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,1980,5.0,2022-07-03,Brilliant,"Rating: 9.7
Overall, a brilliant movie that really builds on where the last movie left off and improves on it in so many ways to make it a very memorable film that is not only the best in the series but in film history as we see a more mature Star Wars in the characters that take part in it."
tt0367594,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,2005,4.0,2022-07-04,Good,"Rating: 8.4
Overall, a good movie that is well made and driven by its Director and lead actor (Johnny Depp) as it is fun to see us go into the world of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but it suffers from a mismanaged plot structure to the point where the final 30 minutes really feels like a chore to go through."
tt6264654,Free Guy,2021,3.0,2022-07-05,Decent,"Rating: 7.3
Overall, a fun watch that plays into the tech/gamer world pretty well, but falters from a simplistic delivery and a safe ending."
tt5113044,Minions: The Rise of Gru,2022,2.5,2022-07-07,Pretty Bad,"Rating: 6.1
Overall, its just a kids movie with adorable moments, but not that serious of a movie (even though the social media marketing has made it an importance to go see this movie (which I do love))."
tt3704428,Elvis,2022,3.0,2022-07-07,Decent,"Rating: 7.3
Overall, a movie that is carried by the performance of its lead actor in the titular performance, but is held back by its poor story writing and plot structure."
tt0374900,Napoleon Dynamite,2004,3.5,2022-07-07,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.5
Overall, a cult classic that is an embodiment of deadpan humor as the filmmakers really tried to get the most out of what they could from a low-budget movie, and it really shows."
tt0083658,Blade Runner,1982,2.5,2022-07-15,Pretty Bad,"Rating: 6.3
Overall, a movie that has a huge following and big impact on the sci-fi genre as it begs many questions about humanity and what it means to be alive, but does not live up to such a high billing as it is poorly executed by its director and actors to the point that is is pretty hard to pay attention and watch due to how boring it is."
tt10648342,Thor: Love and Thunder,2022,2.0,2022-07-15,Bad,"Rating: 5.4
Overall, a movie that is poorly executed and cannot be saved with Thor's charm as it tries too hard to be funny with its meta jokes and constant volume of jokes (even when it mostly does not work) as this takes away from actually building a storyline that should really be developed, the relationship between Thor and Jane and how Thor comes to terms with being at the end of his character arc."
tt0208092,Snatch,2000,3.5,2022-07-18,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.6
Overall, a fun watch with a pretty well written story and iconic editing sequences but is pretty simplistic in terms of its execution."
tt0365748,Shaun of the Dead,2004,4.0,2022-07-19,Very Good,"Rating: 8.8
Overall, a very good satire that is a fun laugh as it pokes at the zombie genre in a very unique way, though it can be very simplistic and safe at times."
tt1499658,Horrible Bosses,2011,2.5,2022-07-25,Pretty Bad,"Rating: 6.3
Overall, an enjoyable movie with funny performances from the experienced cast, but is overall very simple and bland in terms of writing."
tt15339456,Marcel the Shell with Shoes On,2021,4.0,2022-07-29,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a very cute movie that is very simple on the surface but has a little bit more depth for a children's movie (especially for how low-budget it looked)."
tt10954984,Nope,2022,4.0,2022-08-02,Good,"Rating: 8.4
Overall, a more traditional horror movie for Jordan Peele that has a good mix of horror and comedic in a big-budget project that make it a good watch, but the actual conflict of the movie is really lacking to where it really holds the film back from being something special."
tt2372776,Blue Bayou,2021,3.0,2022-08-02,Decent,"Rating: 7.3
Overall, a movie that is carried solely by Justin Chon with a performance that makes the audience engaged with the film and his struggle (with some good elements of direction as well), but the movie heavily dragged back by the other characters and their scenes as it is really hard to watch at times."
tt6710474,Everything Everywhere All at Once,2022,4.5,2022-08-05,Great,"Rating: 9.1
Overall, a great movie that is very unique in how it blends many genres that is driven by its performances, writing, and action, but it does falter a bit from an inconsistent plot structure, fast pacing, and ending that is very feel good."
tt0120663,Eyes Wide Shut,1999,3.5,2022-08-18,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.9
Overall, an interesting watch as the audience gets to see Kubrick give off his sendoff (with many elements that are synonymous to his style) in a story that captivating for the most part, but does not deliver to the level he is known for with not so great writing and final act that really falls apart towards the end."
tt12593682,Bullet Train,2022,2.0,2022-08-19,Bad,"Rating: 5.4
Overall, a movie that is entertaining for the action elements and some comedic moments, but is not a good movie in terms of writing, story structure, and overall feel."
tt11291274,The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,2022,2.5,2022-08-20,Pretty Bad,"Rating: 6.3
Overall, an entertaining movie that has some funny moments and noticeable acting (especially with Nic Cage), but reeks too much like a early 2010s comedy to the point where it feels very dated in its style (that is this movie would be a lot better if it came out 10 years earlier)."
tt2911666,John Wick,2014,2.5,2022-08-21,Pretty Bad,"Rating: 6.7
Overall, a movie that is not so great in its own right with its lackluster direction, acting, and screenplay, but is an enjoyable watch because of its intense action scenes and character writing of John Wick (painting a character that will be fun to see what happens next to him)."
tt0086190,Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi,1983,4.0,2022-08-28,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a step back from the previous Star Wars films by reverting back similar bad habits (with George Lucas's poor dialogue and over use of effects), but the movie does do a good job in ending the saga with its world-building and great storytelling (something that makes the Original Trilogy one of the most respected in movie history)."
tt0083866,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,1982,4.5,2022-09-03,Great,"Rating: 9.4
Overall, an iconic family movie that captures the hearts of its audiences through its titular character and the character's plight of trying to make his way back home, taking the audience on an emotional adventure that is guided with Spielberg's incredible direction, groundbreaking cinematography, and iconic John Williams Score."
tt13223398,Beast,2022,1.5,2022-09-04,Bad,"Rating: 4.4
Overall, a very poorly executed movie with almost everything across the board not hitting as Idris Elba cannot save this mess from being watchable, with the poor direction, acting, writing, and sound mixing making the movie more laughable than scary."
tt0118749,Boogie Nights,1997,4.0,2022-09-26,Good,"Rating: 8.1
Overall, a Pretty Good movie that does a good job in helping establishing the scenes and vibe of the subject matter coupled with an interesting story, but is held back from issues in plot construction, some of the performances and writing, and an irrelevant climax (with other scenes being irrelevant as well)."
tt0457430,Pan's Labyrinth,2006,4.0,2022-09-26,Good,"Rating: 8.4
Overall, a Pretty Good movie that does a really good job at painting a fairy-tale during the Franco Spanish reign as it paints who the real monsters were, but is a very safe movie that has pretty overt symbols and simple writing."
tt0116695,Jerry Maguire,1996,3.5,2022-09-28,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.5
Overall, an entertaining movie that has memorable performances by Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr., but is filled with many cliches of 90s comedies as it is very formulaic and predictable with its decent direction and predictable storyline."
tt10731256,Don't Worry Darling,2022,1.5,2022-10-30,Bad,"Rating: 4.1
Overall, a movie that was not executed well and really misses the mark in what it tries to show as it fails from poor direction and writing that make the movie more boring than thrilling."
tt1655389,Blonde,2022,0.0,2022-11-02,Terrible,"Rating: 1.5
Overall, a Terrible movie that has a message of showing how corrupted Monroe's life became with the external pressures around her from being able to be herself, but the fails across the board in so many aspects that watching the movie feels like a waste of time at how bad and boring it is that you really don't care about anything from this movie."
tt15791034,Barbarian,2022,3.0,2022-11-09,Decent,"Rating: 7.2
Overall, a fun, suspenseful watch that builds story pretty well and does many elements of horror right as you go farther into the conflict, but is pretty bare-bones when it comes to filmmaking, acting, and writing."
tt0167260,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,2003,4.5,2022-11-30,Great,"Rating: 9.2
Overall, a great conclusion to the trilogy as it helps tie loose ends and bring the story to a close in an epic fashion, but the movie is very story dense (that could have been a bit tighter) that needs to seen as a continuation of the previous films rather than being a stand-alone film."
tt9114286,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,2022,3.0,2022-12-03,Decent,"Rating: 7.0
Overall, a marvel movie that is a bit different considering how it deals with loss and grief, but is still flawed with its uninteresting plot and boilerplate Marvel template."
tt11813216,The Banshees of Inisherin,2022,4.0,2022-12-04,Very Good,"Rating: 8.8
Overall, a movie that does not have that many bells and whistles (and therefore could have probably been better as a play) as it uses a very well written screenplay with experienced actors (that have great chemistry with the director) to make the movie a memorable and fun watch (as it helps blend comedic themes with more depressing, lonely ones)."
tt1856101,Blade Runner 2049,2017,4.0,2022-12-04,Good,"Rating: 8.3
Overall, a very technically sound movie that uses advancements in filmmaking and technology to help make a better movie that its predecessor, though it still falters a bit in terms of bland writing/acting that is still very slow in pace."
tt9764362,The Menu,2022,3.0,2022-12-19,Decent,"Rating: 7.4
Overall, a movie that is carried by the performances of Fiennes and Taylor-Joy as they both show their talent in staying afloat in a movie that has a very forced screenplay with an inconsistent tone, though it is an enjoyable watch that does have good moments."
tt14208870,The Fabelmans,2022,4.0,2022-12-20,Very Good,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a very personal movie from Spielberg that goes through his coming of age story as we see why he became a filmmaker and different homages to his most famous works, but overstays its welcome with the third act really falling apart and being cliche."
tt0499549,Avatar,2009,3.5,2022-12-28,Pretty Good,"Rating: 7.8
Overall, a groundbreaking film at the time it was released, but has become incredibly dated given how far technology has advanced since the movie was released, causing the movie to fall back on mediocre filmmaking with a very predictable/copied story due to how much the film relies on CGI to tell the story."
tt13833688,The Whale,2022,3.0,2023-01-04,Decent,"Rating: 7.2
Overall, a movie that is carried by Fraser's performance with a story that is very heartbreaking, but feels very similar to other Aronofsky films (like Black Swan and The Wrestler) which takes away at something great they could have had, coupled with a hit-or-miss screenplay and questionable performances from the rest of the cast."
tt1630029,Avatar: The Way of Water,2022,3.0,2023-01-10,Decent,"Rating: 7.2
Overall, an improvement in terms of the technical aspects and the acting, but overall just feels like the same movie as the first as the story coupled with the very long runtime make the movie pretty hard to watch towards the end (though it is still a decent watch in terms of how pretty the world they created was)."
tt8178634,RRR,2022,4.0,2023-01-10,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a Telugu movie that does falter a bit from the given Telugu tropes, but overall transcends Tollywood as Rajamouli builds from the progress made from Baahubali to show what Telugu filmmaking can be as he creates a well digestible Epic that is driven by the performances of the two leads, good writing, and technical achievements in order to show India can stand on the same footing as the Western world in making films."
tt10640346,Babylon,2022,2.0,2023-01-11,Bad,"Rating: 5.3
Overall, a chaotic mess from a talented director as he fails to direct his poorly constructed narrative cause he tries too hard to go for shock and humor that it goes for grotesque and unwatchable, so much to the point that even the competent performances cannot even save the train-wreck that is over three hours long."
tt8633464,After Yang,2021,2.5,2023-01-12,Pretty Bad,"Rating: 6.3
Overall, a slow-burn that is a quick representation of how AI can make an impact on families as this family looks for the humanity of their artificial child, bringing in some interesting ideas but ultimately ends up being a bit boring and hard to follow because of the very dull tone and lack of direction."
tt3915174,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,2022,4.5,2023-01-13,Great,"Rating: 9.4
Overall, a movie that at the surface plays very well for children as it follows the iconic Puss in Boots on his adventure, but overall has a much stronger and deeper meaning of living life without fear and anxiety as the creators synergized incredible animation with great writing to make this movie a must watch."
tt11564570,Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,2022,4.0,2023-01-16,Very Good,"Rating: 8.6
Overall, a sequel that is pretty on par with the first as it takes many aspects (like the overall who-done-it style for a cast of flawed characters) while still trying to be different (like giving it more of a Summer feel), but does not live up entirely as the story construction (especially the retelling of the story) and topical nature of the movie (bringing up COVID) holds it back a bit."
tt0298203,8 Mile,2002,4.0,2023-01-18,Good,"Rating: 8.3
Overall, an entertaining movie that has really great moments and showcases great hip-hop, all lead by a good performance from Eminem as he drives the movie to a great climax of Rap Battles, but is held back a bit from the pretty standard/boilerplate elements and not great performances from the minor characters."
tt8760708,M3GAN,2022,2.5,2023-01-20,Pretty Bad,"Rating: 6.6
Overall, a movie that does a decent job at mixing horror elements with comedy, but falters when coming to direction, acting, and story as it is just a modern retelling of the possessed doll trope (which makes it pretty predictable)."
tt14444726,Tár,2022,4.0,2023-02-02,Very Good,"Rating: 8.7
Overall, a masterclass in subtlety as the direction mixed with Blanchett's performance drives forward a very intense movie without doing/saying that much, but the film's potential is ultimately held back by its long runtime and poor plot construction (which is a shame because these reasons will limit its staying power in film history)."
tt1488589,Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,2022,3.0,2023-02-16,Decent,"Rating: 7.0
Overall, a decent watch that follows the iconic character of Pinocchio in a unique way as the audience gets to see him tackle darker concepts of the importance of family and what is the meaning of death, but is a pretty hard watch given how choppy the movie is with its lackluster direction, acting that is not fluid, stop motion animation (which is not necessarily a bad thing), and editing."
tt13669038,Women Talking,2022,2.5,2023-02-19,Pretty Bad,"Rating: 6.0
Overall, a movie that has good acting and is good from a micro-scale (especially with the discussion scenes), but really falters on a macro-scale as the direction and bad plot construction really makes the movie very boring and feel like nothing actually happened (to where this movie probably would have been better suited off as a play)."
