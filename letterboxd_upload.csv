Overall, one of the most entertaining cinematic experiences I have ever experienced as this film interweaves three different timelines well to create a redeeming spectical, but the movie has dipped a bit in rewatchablity because it's pretty formulaically Marvel and not as exiciting when you know the suprises.

Overall, a defining comic-book movie that is filled with action, humor, and sadness as we get to see some familiar faces get second chances and get the closure they never got with both their characters and their careers."
