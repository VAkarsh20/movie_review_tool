Overall, a surprisingly decent Saw movie as it does a good job in being more narrative focused as the story and acting of Tobin Bell helps the audience sympathize with his struggle, and the traps and horror writing was the best it has been since the original Saw movie (though it does spend a bit too much time in the exposition and does have a lot of the same flaws that other Saw movies have)."
