Very Good acting by the cast overall (Very Good to Great from Elba, Robbie, and Slyvester Stallone (Voice Acting, little bias though), Very Good from Kinnaman)
Pacing was good to very good (a bit quick at the end but nothing terrible)
Build to the climax was very good with the overall climax being very well executed (bit long though)
runtime was ok but 10-15 minutes of the movie could have been cut (especially at the end)
