Pretty Good acting overall (Good from Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (While there was nothing spectacular about their performances, the chemistry these two have is incredible to where it helps propel the story and the jokes), Pretty Good to Good from Christopher Walken and Bradley Cooper, Great from Will Ferrell (even though it is a cameo and its a bit over-the-top, his scene is one of the most memorable ones of the movie cause of how much command he has and how funny it is), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast)
Pretty Good cinematography
the plot structure was fine for the most part (but I think it should spend a bit more time in the 10 minutes before the climax because the audience is just kinda thrown into Vaughn and Fisher's characters getting married (cause no passage of time is really given, just that they are "moving quickly"))
the build to the climax was decent (while it does have the best moment of the movie (Chazz scene), it really does not go that well into the fallout between Wilson and Vaughn's characters and the laters relationship (maybe like 10 minutes cut from the middle to put into that would have helped))
