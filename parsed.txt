Very Good from Fraces McDormand (Seasoned actor who plays the over-pretective mom very well)
Good performance form Jason Lee (Plays the serious/comedic relief role well as he can switch from both sides very well)
Terrible performance from Jimmy Fallon (It was just so hard to watch how off-beat he was and it felt like he could not read any of his lines)
Good to Very Good Sound (very noticable in the music performances)
the movie is very feel-good and plays to a lot of the style that early 2000s movies had (which is fine) but it just feels like it tries to be very safe as it is going in one direction by falls apart as is corrects iteself in being more safe
