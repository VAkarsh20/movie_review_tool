Bad Acting overall (Very Good to Great from Lady Gaga (her mannerisms were very spot on, but some momenets definitely shinned more than others), Good to Very Good from Adam Driver (Though his accent can get very annoying at times), Good from Jermey Irons (his accent was the only believable one in the entire cast), Pretty Good to Good from Al Pacino (Has his iconic Al Pacino charm but there is still some off with his performance), Bad from Salma Hayek (Considering she is just using her Mexican Accent while playing an Italian character), Horrible from Jared Leto (Possibly one of the worst performances I have every seen, his accent is atrocious, he's comedic when his trying to be serious), range from pretty bad to decent for the rest of the cast)
Inconsistent score (the score was used in moments it was needed and was absent in moments it was despritely needed; its absense helped set the inconsisent tone throughout the movie)
Good to Very Good Costume design (it was supposed to emulate Gucci after all)
Pretty Good to Good editing (helped with some of the moments in the film)
The plot structure was prevelant but not effectively carried out (the movie spends too much time on the rise of the unrecognizable Partizia, that the downfall, climax, and resolution are completely rushed and feel like afterthoughts)
the pacing of the movie felt like it was fine until you realize that there is 30 minutes left of the movie and the real conflict has only started to be introduced (this left the final act incredibly rushed)
the build to the climax is present (but the audience is already disinterested in the movie at this point that it is kinda useless)
the climax and actual key plot point of the movie is horribly conveyed as it is more comical than dramatic
the aura of the movie is present as it was good to see the 70s/80s/90s having an effect on the fashion and designs of Gucci and the soundtrack used
