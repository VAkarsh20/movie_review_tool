Pretty Good from Live-Action: Good from Mark Hamill (A real step back in this performance as he is more reserved and over-the-top (which makes sense given he is now a Jedi), and really is not able to capture the same charm he had in the first two films (even when it is warranted))
Pretty Good to Good from Ian McDiarmid (Though limited, he did show why he was the right choice for the emperor)
Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villian to be scared of)
Very Good from Warwick Davis/other Ewoks (a debut role that really helped play the adorableness of the Ewoks)
the build to climax was good as it helped build the relationships between the different characters (Luke and Vader as well as Han and Leia)
as a movie meant to close out the saga it does a good job in bringing closure to character arcs and stories (but this movie cannot really be a stand alone film)
