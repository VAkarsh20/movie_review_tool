Great Acting Overall (Very Good to Great from Jones (Able to hold her own and was great in the more emotional intense scenes (played the angsty character very well as well)), Great to Incredible from Kotsur (Stole the show with his comedic, humourous moments and was the real emotional rock for the family as his actions play a vital role in Jones's character finding herself), Great from Marlee Matlin (plays her role very well and shows a lot of range), Very Good from the rest of the cast)
Very Good sound editing (espeically with the lack of to mimic how the deaf characters are witnessing the scene)
the plot structure is good (kinda just follows the generic bilsdungroman plot structure so there really are not issues)
pacing of the movie is good (would not really add or cut any scenes as the movie uses its runtime effectively)
the build to the climax is evident and present (kinda predictable though)
the climax is a great performance and a culmination of all the hopes and dreams of the characters (though it was kinda predictable what would happen)
the resolution is touching as it shows how much the family cares for Ruby and how much they care for them
the major issues of the movie is how much this movie plays to the bilsdungroman archetype as it is incredibly predictable and very surface-level in its meanings of growing up and managing conflicts
