Very Good from Salma Hayek (Plays off the other castmates very well and does a good job in helping bring emotion of out Puss)
a great representation of how anxiety and ego take effect on an individual as it masks Puss' fear of death very well with the backdrop of it being a children's movie (something not only few animated films have done but any film really)
