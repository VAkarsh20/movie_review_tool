    director {
      name: "Ridley Scott"
    }
    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is good, as the world and action sequences feel grand and are entertaining; though it feels like they shot this movie with \"Napoleon\"; the direction on a microscale is pretty good, as the acting does feel better this time around from the main cast; the storytelling is exactly the same as \"Gladiator\" in content and \"Napoleon\" in style; they build tension similarly to the first movie"

      comments: "Plays a similar character to Quinn\'s, but with a few screws loose; Does not feel like he embodies the character well as it just comes off as more cringe and laughably bad than believable"

      rating: "Very Good"
      comments: "A true scene stealer as he shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all time; a truly villainous performance as he is able to switch between multiple emotions in a cunning manner effortlessly; he has great chemistry with Mescal"

    comments: "The concept is literally the same movie as the first; The plot structure is exactly the same as the first; Character writing is almost exactly the same as the first movie, with some more depth provided to Mescal\'s character; The story ruins much of the ambiguity of the first movie"

    comments: "The dialogue is still clunky, like the first movie, but filled with moments meant to be iconic; The symbolism is the same as the first movie; The foreshadowing is nonexistent when you realize this is the same movie"

    rating: "Great"
    comments: "It helps set this movie during the Roman Empire;"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is a little faster than the first movie, but still on the slower side, given that this movie is still a Roman epic"
  climax: "The climax is executed well but feels like it has fewer consequences than the first movie"
  tone: "Tone is very much a Roman war epic;"
  final_notes: "It feels like they shot this movie concurrently with \"Napoleon\"; this movie is basically \"Gladiator\" retold"
  overall: "Overall, a pretty good Roman epic that is led by memorable performances from Paul Mescal and Denzel Washington, well-executed technicals, and entertaining action sequences; but, this movie feels like lazy and unoriginal filmmaking from Ridley Scott because the story is exactly the same as the first movie and looks exactly the same as \"Napoleon\""
