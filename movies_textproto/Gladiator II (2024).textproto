    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is good as the world and action sequences feel grand and are entertaining, though it feels like they shot this movie with 'Napoleon'; the direction on a microscale is pretty good as the acting does feel better this time around from the main cast; the storytelling is exactly the same as 'Gladiator' in content and 'Napoleon' in style; they build tension similarly to the first movie"

      comments: "Plays a similiar character to Quinn's, but with a few screws loose; Does not feel like he embodies the character well as it just comes off as more cringy and laughably bad than believable"

    comments: "The concept is literally the same exact movie as the first; the plot structure is the exact same as the first; character writing is almost exactly the same as the first movie, with some more depth provided to Mescal's character; the story ruins a lot of the ambiguity of the first movie"

    comments: "The dialogue is still clunky like the first movie, but filled with moments that are meant to be iconic; the symbolism is the same as the first movie; the foreshadowing is kinda non-existent when you realize this is the same movie"

  pacing: "Pacing is a little faster than the first movie, but still on the slower-side given that this movie is still a Roman epic"
  climax: "Climax is executed well, but feels like it has less consequences than the first movie"
  tone: "Tone is very much a Roman war epic"
  final_notes: "It feels like they shot this movie concurrently with 'Napoleon'; this movie is just basically 'Gladiator' told again"
  overall: "Overall, a pretty good roman epic that is led by memorable performances from Paul Mescal and Denzel Washington, well executed technicals, and entertaining action sequences; but, this movie feels like lazy and unoriginal filmmaking from Ridley Scott because the story is the exactly the same as the first movie and looks exactly the same as 'Napoleon'"
