  director {
   name: "Sam Raimi"
  }
  rating: "Great"
  comments: "The direction on a macroscale is great as uses improved technology and experience from the last film to do a better job at building this comic-book version of New York and creating more grand action sequences; the direction on a microscale is very good as it is a lot less campy and 00s, with it doing a better job at tackling topics on purpose and duty; the direction of actors is good as all the performances are improved since last time and the movie is less campy; the storytelling is very good as it feels very focused and structured, and Raimi does a good job at showing how doubt and purpose effect Peter's decisions; he builds tension very well"

  comments: "The concept is great as they built on everything they created in the first film and tackle deeper topics like balancing wants and obligations; the plot structure is laid out well; character writing is great as you really see the weight of the world affecting Peter and the dilemma to make decisions based on what he wants and what he has to do, and the villain writing is very good"

  rating: "Very Good"
  comments: "The dialogue is a strong improvement as it is less campy and is more profound when it needs to be; the humor is very good as it is used effectively and gives the movie a more playful/comic-book feel, but there still are some campy moments that are still unintentionally funny; the symbolism is more prevalent as the whole movie is about Peter finding balance with so much weight put on him; the foreshadowing is good and helps tell the story"

 visual_effects {
  rating: "Great"
  comments: "Uses advanced technology very well to push the bounds of 00s visual effects to make this movie very iconic and groundbreaking (but it is still obvious where they used a blue screen and how far we've come in terms of VFX technology)"
