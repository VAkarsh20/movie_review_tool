      comments: "Played the hot head pretty well and really made it known the presence he had in every scene, but showed his inexperience when it came to different scenes (very Tom Cruise esque performance overall)"

      comments: "Played the comic relief sidekick well and showed the more moral/cautious side that Maverick needed to go to as he tried to pull him away from being being reckless, but had some really questionable delivery of lines with some of his material (which may not necessarily be his fault)"

    comments: "Was pretty standard for the first 2/3 of the movie and was very predictable (especially how 80s it was), but the moments building up to the climax were a bit new and something that I did not expect, though the ending was very predictable in the end; did do a good job in calling back different elements of the story throughout the movie; also the movie does do a good job at character writing for the fighter pilots as you do care for them"

    comments: "The actual dialogue was very 80s and pretty basic/surface level, but there were iconic lines and moments that I did enjoy; also, the minor use of symbolism was a nice touch for writing that was overall pretty surface level"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was very generic and pretty boilerplate with most movies of the 80s (everything but the building to the climax was very predictable and even that was pretty standard once you knew the direction they were going)"
  pacing: "Pacing was good (the issue was that the movie just jumps at different points in the plot (which makes the audience think that 20 minutes could have really been added to bridge these gaps in plot))"
  climax: "Build to climax was the most unique part of the movie as it is good as it follows the standard buildup to a fight that many 80s movies do; climax was well done as it was a dogfight that the movie really builds to throughout the movie/what the audience really wanted to see; the execution of the scene was well done"
  tone: "Tone was incredibly 80s and that was what the movie was kinda known for (a fun movie about fighter pilots who have friendships and relationships with the people around them)"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, an iconic movie that is a fun watch but really does reek of the 80s with its writing and acting as the audience has to get past the pretty simple plot to see the moments that make Top Gun a famous movie for its time"
