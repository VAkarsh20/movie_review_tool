    rating: "Bad"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is very simple and feel-good, makes it feel like this movie was made explicitly for \"Booktok\" ; the direction on a microscale is very bland, forced, and simple ; the storytelling is incredibly simple and bland as it reads like a mother reading this story back to me"

    comments: "The concept is actually very dumb, and it is obvious this movie was made for \'Booktok\' because the book is a \'Booktok\' book; not only is the concept dumb, they do a bad job actually introducing it and showing its importance because it only feels like a small detail throughout the movie; the plot structure is very plain and simple; the character writing is pretty good, even though it is very overt, because the main character is a symbol for the struggles with motherhood and how it is ok not to be the perfect mom"

    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The dialogue is simple, bland, and written as if it were for \"Booktok\" ; the dialogue is so bad that there is literally a scene within the first 20 minutes of the movie where the main character says \"I am Nightbitch\" ; the humor is fine, but very forced ; the symbolism is profound, as the whole movie is about the struggles of motherhood and accepting that nothing is a model mom or person ; the foreshadowing is only there because the movie is very formulaic"

  pacing: "The pacing is a little slow because the narration moves the story forward"
  climax: "The climax is pretty forced"
  tone: "The tone feels very much like this movie was made for \"Booktok\""
  final_notes: "Saw premiere at the Austin Film Festival; It is obvious who this movie is for, I am clearly not the target demographic; This was supposed to be the movie that saved Amy Adams, not destroy her"
  overall: "Overall, a pretty bad movie that just feels like it was made for \'Booktok\'; Amy Adams can only do so much given how dumb the story is, despite its strong messages about the struggles of motherhood"
