title: "The Master"
rating: 9.1
review: "Incredible Acting by the entire case (Especially Phoneix and Hoffman), Great Screenplay, Good Story, Great Direction, Great Score, Incredible Cinematography, Very Surface level in terms of its meanings as I would like it to have gone a bit deeper in its symbolism and its criticisms of the cult, Lot of unnessearly weird dialogue"
