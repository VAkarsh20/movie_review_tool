title: "Hustlers"
rating: 8.0
review: "Acting by Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu was very good, Story was good but ending was kinda meh and very rushed, pacing was not very consistent, Very enjoyable and entertaining movie (Except Lizzo). The movie is a biopic of Cardi B and was very ironic that her character was gone after the drugging happened."
