    comments: "Even with a short runtime, it feels like most of the narrative was introduced and wrapped up in a succinct manner; the story was a bit predictable however"

    comments: "The dialogue was incredibly corny and very predictable at parts; the symbolism and message of the movie was kinda shallow and not really that compelling; foreshadowing was pretty standard"

    comments: "Kinda cartoony/Video Game-esque but I enjoyed it"
  }
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was pretty standard and formulaic; the short runtime forces the movie to really follow a boilerplate to progress the story forward"
  pacing: "Pacing was incredibly fast because of the short runtime (this then becomes an issue because it does not have time to explore relationships they introduced (like the main love interest); it would have been nice to see 15 minutes added to just slow down the pace)"
  climax: "Climax was decent as it was a typical fight scene (but executed well)"
  tone: "Tone was very lighthearted (which made the movie not take itself too seriously)"
  final_notes: "The narration really took away from the storytelling and made the movie feel more corny; the action scenes were well choreographed and definitely a plus for the movie for how visual they were"
  overall: "Overall, a movie with memorable performances from Hoult and Cage and well executed action sequences, but has incredibly corny writing and is very formulaic and predictable"
