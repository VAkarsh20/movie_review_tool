review {
  direction {
    director {
      name: "Chris McKay"
    }
    comments: "Decent Direction (Pretty safe and formulaic in its storytelling and direction of actors, but does a good job in the action sequences)"
  }
  acting {
    actor {
      name: "Nicholas Hoult"
      comments: "Pretty Good from Nicholas Hoult (Plays the anxious protagonist pretty well and commands the scenes he is in with a sense of charm)"
    }
    actor {
      name: "Awkwafina"
      comments: "Pretty Bad to Decent from Awkwafina (While her performance isn\'t bad, it is just pretty corny overall (which can kinda be a fault of the script and not her))"
    }
    actor {
      name: "Ben Schwartz"
      comments: "Pretty Bad to Decent from Ben Schwartz (It was just hard to believe him as the villain)"
    }
    actor {
      name: "Nicolas Cage"
      comments: "Good from Nicolas Cage (Really brings to life the character as it seems like this version of Dracula was written for him)"
    }
    cast: "Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast"
    comments: "Pretty Bad to Decent Acting"
  }
  story {
    writer {
      name: "Robert Kirkman"
    }
    comments: "Decent to Pretty Good Story (Even with a short runtime, it feels like most of the narrative was introduced and wrapped up in a succinct manner; the story was a bit predictable however)"
  }
  screenplay {
    writer {
      name: "Ryan Ridley"
    }
    comments: "Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was incredibly corny and very predictable at parts; the symbolism and message of the movie was kinda shallow and not really that compelling; foreshadowing was pretty standard)"
  }
  score {
    composer {
      name: "Marco Beltrami"
    }
    comments: "Decent Score"
  }
  cinematography {
    cinematographer {
      name: "Mitchell Amundsen"
    }
    comments: "Good Cinematography (Especially in the fight scenes)"
  }
  sound: "Good Sound"

    editor {
      name: "Zene Baker"
    }
    comments: "Pretty Good Editing"
  }
  visual_effects: "Good Visual Effects (Kinda cartoony/Video Game-esque but I enjoyed it)"
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was pretty standard and formulaic; the short runtime forces the movie to really follow a boilerplate to progress the story forward"
  pacing: "Pacing was incredibly fast because of the short runtime (this then becomes an issue because it does not have time to explore relationships they introduced (like the main love interest); it would have been nice to see 15 minutes added to just slow down the pace)"
  climax: "Climax was decent as it was a typical fight scene (but executed well)"
  tone: "Tone was very lighthearted (which made the movie not take itself too seriously)"
  final_notes: "The narration really took away from the storytelling and made the movie feel more corny; the action scenes were well choreographed and definitely a plus for the movie for how visual they were"
  overall: "Overall, a movie with memorable performances from Hoult and Cage and well executed action sequences, but has incredibly corny writing and is very formulaic and predictable"
