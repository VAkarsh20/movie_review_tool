    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is very similar in style to both \"Trainspotting\" and \"8 Mile,\" but it feels more derivative of both rather than adding anything new to the genres; The direction on a microscale is good, as this is where you see the chemistry and message of the music group; The storytelling is pretty simple, as it follows the \"Trainspotting\" and \"8 Mile\" template; They artificially force tension in an entertaining way"

    comments: "The concept is pretty interesting as it is based on the real-life group \'Kneecap,\' with the bandmates playing themselves; The concept derives from both \"Trainspotting\" and \"8 Mile\"; The plot structure is pretty similar to \"8 Mile\" and other biopics; The character writing is pretty good as the bandmates play themselves and you can see their personalities come out through the script"

    comments: "The dialogue interweaves English and Gaelic very well as it helps show the identity Irish people have in Northern Ireland; The humor is pretty good as it feels similar to \"Trainspotting\"; The symbolism is surprisingly profound as the movie\'s message is about the importance of keeping indigenous languages alive, as Kneecap uses their rap to help spread this message"
