    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is very similiar in style to both 'Trainspotting' and '8 Mile,' but it feels more derivative of both rather than adding anything new to the genres; the direction on a microscale is good as this is where you see the chemistry and message of the music group; the storytelling is pretty simple as it follows the 'Trainspotting' and '8 Mile' template; they artificially force tension in an entertaining way"

    comments: "The concept is pretty intersting as it is based on the real life group 'Kneecap,' with the bandmates playing themselves; the concept derives from both \"Trainspotting\" and \"8 Mile\"; the plot structure is pretty similiar to '8 Mile' and other biopics; the character writing is pretty good as the bandmates play themselves, and you can see their personalities come out through the script"

    comments: "The dialogue interweaves English and Gaelic very well as it helps show the identity Irish has for these people of Northern Island; the humor is pretty good as it feels similiar to \"Trainspotting\"; the symbolism is suprisingly profound as the message of the movie is about the importance of keeping indigiounus languages alive, as Kneecap uses their rap to help spread this message"
