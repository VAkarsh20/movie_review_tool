    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is pretty surface-level as it just feels like they are moving the plot forward, using two distinct periods of Dylan's life; The direction on a microscale is pretty good as you do get to see Dylan's character and how he interacts with people, the problem is that he is just very boring; the storytelling is very surface-level, I feel like I do not learn that much about Bob Dylan on a deeper level; it feels like he only took this project on because music biopics are hot and he did 'Walk the Line'"

      comments: "Brings to life Bob Dylan and does a decent job with playing his songs, but it feels like a very one-dimension performance because of how boring Bob Dylan is; it is noticable at parts that he is not a musician; does not do a great job building chemistry with the rest of the cast, but this might just be how Bob Dylan was"

      comments: "Plays the folk mentor to Chalamet in a pretty good way and captures the essense of the character, it is just his chemistry with Chalamet isn't great to make this a memorable performance"

      comments: "Plays a decent Johnny Cash; James Mangold literally could have done the best marketing ever and got Joaquin Phoniex to reprise his role in 'Walk the line' to make this like within the same universe; his relationship with Bob Dylan is very surface level because it just feels like he was added to show that this was the same director of 'Walk the Line'"

    comments: "The concept is not the best as it feels like a surface-level biopic on Bob Dylan because all you learn is that he is a boring person; the plot structure is a little all over the place because the movie is split into two parts, with the first part dragging a lot and the second part moving too fast; the character writing was not good because this is just such a surface level biopic where we learn nothing about Bob Dylan"

    comments: "The dialogue is pretty good and true to the time; the symbolism is pretty good as the movie shares the sentiments that Bob Dylan felt when he felt like he was a monkey dancing for fans and his label, and why he wanted to branch into a new genre so that he can own his own piece of work; the foreshadowing is not handled well"

  pacing: "Pacing is all over the place because the first half felt too slow and the second half felt too fast; the movie really needed like 15-20 minutes because it feels like a lot of this movie was cut out; the passage of time is not handled well"
  climax: "Climax feels more headscratching than interesting because it feels like it overly dramatizes what happens, like they act as if Bob Dylan committed a hate crime"
  tone: "Tone is a huge problem for this movie because the tone is very PG-13, but it is only Rated R because the movie becomes edgy and starts saying the F word with Bob becomes rebellious"
  final_notes: "This movie is just unnecessarily Rated R because it could have easily been PG-13; The problem with this movie is that Bob Dylan is just a boring person so we don't learn anything interesting about him"
  overall: "Overall, a decent biopic that has good music and good performances from Timoth\303\251e Chalamet and the rest of the cast, but the movie just feels very surface-level in its storytelling because all I learned from this movie was that Bob Dylan was a very boring person"
