title: "The Terminator"
rating: 6.8
review: "Acting on a spectrum (Arnold Schwarzenegger was good, Linda Hamilton was pretty good, Michael Biehn and some of the cops were decent but over-the-top at times, extras were very bad), Very Good/Iconic Story, Iconic lines (Which were perfected in the sequel) but very bad screenplay overall as the dialogue was very stiff/forced/not natural, Pretty good score (Sequel perfected the themes) as it gave a very 80s/retro futuristic feel and builds tension with the consent loud beating, Very Poor production design/visual effects when displaying the future, good makeup (Very good for Arnold), cinematography was pretty bad (Good for some scenes but very bad in others), action sequences were choreographed very well), Direction was on the spectrum (Good during moments of action and crisis but poor when directing other plot moments), good sound mixing, good pacing average (very good in terms of plot development but can be rushed or drag at times), climax was good in terms of action and suspense, The movie has a decent budget but looks like a student film at times. Overall, the movie is decent in terms of a watch but as a movie overall lacks in a lot of areas, but these areas are definitely improved upon and made better with the sequel as the budget/experience to make a better movie was there."
