title: "The Terminator"
rating: 7.1
review: "Acting on the spectrum (Arnold was good, Linda was pretty good, Kyle Reese and some of the cops were decent but over-the-top at times, extras were very poor), Very Good/Iconic Story, Iconic lines (Which were perfected in the sequel) but very poor screenplay overall as the dialogue was very stiff/forced/not natural, Pretty good score (Sequel perfected the themes) as gave a very 80s/retro futuristic feel and builds tension with the consent loud beating, Very Poor production design/visual effects when displaying the future, good makeup (Very good for arnold), cinemotography medicore (Good for some scenes but very poor in others), action sequences were chorographed very well), Direction was on the spectrum (Good during moments of action and crisis but poor when directing other plot moments), good sound mixing, good pacing average (very good in terms of plot development but can be rushed or drag at times), climax was good in terms of action and suspenese, The movie has a decent budget but looks like a student film at times, Overall, the movie is decent in terms of a watch but as a movie overall lacks alot of areas, but these areas are definetly expanded upon and made better with the sequel as the budget/experience to make a better movie was there."
