    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is good as they create this cute, claymation world that makes Aardman films such beloved artpieces; the direction on a microscale brings out the cute, silly nature that makes Wallace & Gromit iconic; the storytelling keeps things very simple; they build tension in a very funny way as it makes the movie more adorable yet hype"

    comments: "The concept is very cute and adorable because it creates this revenge story for one of Wallace & Gromit's most iconic villians; the plot structure is pretty simple because the movie is only 79 minutes long; the character writing is good as it brings back iconic characters in Wallace & Gromit, and does so much with little audio"

    comments: "The dialogue is pretty traditional to Wallace & Gromit; the humor is very adorable and silly; symbolism is an integral part to the movie because the whole film is a message about the rise in AI and the over-reliance on technology; the movie's symbolism is a little too overt because it feels very on the nose when they discuss it; the foreshadowing is good as it is integral to the climax"
