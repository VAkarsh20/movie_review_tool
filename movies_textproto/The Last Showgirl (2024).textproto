    comments: "The direction on a macroscale feels very raw and artistic, similar to \"The Wrestler\" ; the direction on a microscale is decent as you get a sense of what Pamela Anderson\'s character is fighting against in these scenes, but there is a lot of stiffness in these scenes ; the storytelling feels raw as you see the story from the lens of the main character as she navigates this new chapter of her life, and this feels very similar to \"The Wrestler\""

    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The concept is very similar to \'The Wrestler\', a story about a past-their-prime performer looking to navigate through this next phase of their life; the plot structure is pretty linear, but its short runtime makes the movie feel a little unfinished; character writing is good because this character movie about a past-their-prime performer makes the movie interesting as you see how they come to terms with this next phase of their life"

    comments: "The dialogue is good; the humor is pretty playful; the symbolism is pretty good as the images and symbols of this past-their-prime star really show the beauty in aging and finding purpose in life as you enter a new phase; the structure of the movie means there really isn\'t that much foreshadowing because it starts at the end"

  pacing: "Pacing is too fast, as the runtime feels too short; 15-20 minutes could have been added to help strengthen the narrative and give more of a relationship between the mother and daughter"
  climax: "Climax is good because it leaves the movie where it should"
  tone: "Tone is very artsy and gritty; tone feels very similar to \"The Wrestler\""
  final_notes: "I saw the premiere at the Austin Film Festival"
  overall: "Overall, a pretty good movie that is the female version of \"The Wrestler\" ; this film is an artistic and raw presentation of a past-their-prime performer entering the next chapter of their life, carried out by a strong lead performance from Pamela Anderson"
