title: "Toy Story 4"
rating: 9.3
review: "An Unnecessary movie given Toy Story 3 but I am very happy they made this movie, Incredible Story, Incredible Screenplay, Typical Great Voice acting (Its Toy story after all), focuses too much on Woody and kinda relegates the importance of Buzz in his life as well as completely forgets Andy\'s old Toys and Jesse, Great Score, Beautiful animations and it can easily be seen the improvement in Pixar\'s animation skills, Great ending to the Woody Arc of Toy story."
