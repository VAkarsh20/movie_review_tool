    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is pretty good as they build overarching tension in the world well, and has a lot of scenic shots for such a low budget; the direction on a microscale is where the movie comes to life as they do a good job capturing the tension and awkwardness between the couple in group scenes, but the interpersonal scenes between the American couple could have been executed a bit better; the storytelling is pretty good as they use tension well to move the story forward; they build tension very well as it is a main contributing factor in pushing the story forward, keeping the movie engaging, and showing the conflict between the two couples"

    comments: "The concept is interesting for the most part as it really shows why you shouldn\'t stay in touch with family you meet on vacation, but the climax feels pretty typical to other thrillers and the rationale is kinda lazy; the plot structure is pretty similar to other thrillers; character writing is pretty good as it hints at the complicated relationships of both couples, and how twisted the antagonists really are, though it would have been great if they provided them more backstory as it felt kinda forced in the climax"

    comments: "The dialogue is pretty well written as it is witty and flows well; they inject humor very nicely as there are many moments where the movie feels more like a black comedy than a thriller, especially in the first hour; the symbolism is pretty shallow as the rationale for the conflict feels like lazy writing; the foreshadowing is good as it is used well in the climax to explain what is going on and influence the characters\' decisions, but it also makes it a bit predictable at times"

    comments: "The sets in the European countryside really show the beauty in seclusion, and how far away people are from safety and home"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is fine for the most part, but feels a little bit slow in the first hour; it could have been cut 10-15 minutes to make the movie feel a little tighter"
  climax: "The climax was pretty predictable as it was the typical thriller climax and did not feel like it was doing anything new as there were many moments that felt predictable"
  tone: "Tone is a mix between black comedy and thriller"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, a pretty good thriller that feels more like a black comedy as it comically does a good job at showing the awkward tension between the two families, but holds itself back by its lazy and predictable writing in the climax; it shows why you should never continue to be friends with family you met on vacation"
