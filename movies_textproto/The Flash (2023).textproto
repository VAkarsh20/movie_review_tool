    comments: "Took a page out of the Deadpool/Spider-man playbook to tell a pretty meta story about a young superhero trying to find his purpose and get past his past traumas; does a decent job in the macro elements, but a better job in the more micro ones; gets a decent amount out of his actors"

    comments: "Dialogue was decent throughout (some lines were better written then others), humor was pretty good throughout the movie (even though it got a bit meta a times (not a terrible thing though cause its the character)), symbolism is pretty minor throughout; foreshadowing was a pretty good as it helped tie things together in the end (though it could be argued that it follows the template of other time-travel/multi-verse movies)"

    comments: "The more minor use of CGI was fine, but just felt over-saturated in the more grand elements; the Deep-fake/CGI of people was really in the uncanny valley as it was so obvious that the people were not real"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was pretty standard as it followed a template that other time-travel/multiverse movies uses (with it being clear which part of the story arc the audience is in); the exposition was a bit long"
  pacing: "Pacing was a decent throughout the movie (the exposition was a bit longer/slower than I would have liked, but the movie hits its right pace towards the middle of the movie); the runtime for the movie was fine (maybe the exposition could have been 10 minutes shorter)"
  climax: "Climax was decent and shows the true revelation of what the movie is trying to show (which is nice as it uses the final fight as build to this rather than it being the climax itself)"
  tone: "Tone was very meta and playful (which I did like even though I am not so much of a fan of this style); felt like a mix of Deadpool and Spider-Man"
  final_notes: "I saw an early screening of this movie (so it was not the final cut)"
  overall: "Overall, a decent superhero movie as the more micro elements of the movie coupled with the playful tone made the film a fun watch and engaging overall (especially the dual role of Ezra Miller and Michael Keaton returning as Batman), but the overuse of CGI and the pretty predictable plot makes this movie a bit too late in the race to the Multiverse"
