rating: 8.1
review: "REDUX: (09/04/22) Good to Very Good Direction (Able to move the story forward (though in a more cautious manner) and execute the action scenes very well; also does a pretty good job in getting the most of out his actors (though they are limited throughout the movie)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good Felicity Jones (Able to command all the scenes she is in and be a very vocal leader with her cast and during the action scenes, though she does some limitations when it comes to the more powerful scenes), Good from Diego Luna (Able to hold his own for a majority of the movie and does well in the more action-packed scenes, but he shows his ceiling in many of the dramatic scenes), Very Good from Ben Mendelsohn (able to play the villian role very well and shows range throughout the movie in being that menacing figure wanting more power), Great from Alan Tudyk (Really steals the show with his performance as he plays the smartwitted/comedic relief character), Pretty Good to Good from Riz Ahmed (Plays the anxious character well but does show a bit of inexperience to where his character is not that believable), Decent from Forest Whitaker (Very over-the-top in his performance but does a good job in commanding the scenes he is in), Decent from James Earl Jones (Something just feels very off from his performance (probably from the age), but he does do a good job in making Vader feel like a menacing presense), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (just typical Star Wars level acting)), Very Good to Great Story (The architecture of the story is very well laid out and entertaining (even though there are massive deviations from the traditional storytelling), though the storytelling is a bit on the safer side and not as  ambitious as other Star Wars movies; the story also does try to jam a lot into it and this takes away from building some of the side characters and their relationships to the story), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (While there were some iconic lines, a lot of this movie is filled with corny dialogue meant to build power (but just ends up being a bit more laughable; The character writing for some of the characters were really good but they introduce so many characters that it just waters down all the new introductions; the foreshadowing, symbolism, and allusions to A New Hope were very well executed as it helps paint a more hollistic picture of the first Star Wars movie (especially painting the rebellion to be a bit more on the darker side)), Very Good to Great Score (Helps keep that Star Wars feel while adding new themes to the universe), Great Cinematography, Incredible Sound, Incredible Editing, Great to Incredible Visual Effects (Everything from this movie was incredible but the Deepfakes did show their age as it falls more into the uncanny valley now), Very Good Production Design, Very Good Makeup, Great Costumes (Helps pay homage to A New Hope\'s costumes), Plot Structure was very well executed from a macro level as it helps entertain the audience but there is a lot jammed into the movie that it takes away from helping build the characters and their importance (they are kinda just plopped into the story), Pacing was a bit on the faster side cause of how much they try to jam (if they cut like cut 30 minutes of new content/characters and used it to slow the pace and build up some of their characters the movie would have a bit better execution), the build to climax was very well done and is a bit similiar to other blockbuster/Star Wars movies, climax was incredibly executed and the best part of the movie (whether it be from the fights on the ground to the fire fights), tone of the movie is very similiar to other Star Wars movies but the movie does have a bit of a unique feel that is seperate, the movie does a great job in displaying fan service as it does a good job in showing the importance and elements of the original film (whether it be the allusions or the ending scene that is jaw-dropping in its execution). Overall, an entertaining movie that helps rejuvenate the Star Wars franchise through its well executed action scenes and fan-service to the original film, though it is filled with corny dialogue and introduction of too many new elements that it not able to be on the same par as the original trilogy.. ORIGINAL: 8.5. Final Third of the movie was amazing, great action, great plot, has a gradual progression from slow to fast pace, not a memorable cast due to the fact that they all die.  "
