    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is good as it creates the surrealist world that matches the writting of William S. Burroughs; the direction on a microscale is pretty bad as a lot of the 1-on-1 scenes are very boring; the storytelling is pretty surrealist as you do not know what is true; he builds tension in a very weird way"

    comments: "The concept is interesting as an idea, but not really carried out that well; the plot structure is alright as the movie is split up into chapters, but it does not really feel balanced; the character writing is not good as it does not really provide any depth into these characters as all of them just feel very boring"
