    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is good as it creates the surrealist world that matches the writing of William S. Burroughs; The direction on a microscale is pretty bad as a lot of the one-on-one scenes are very boring; The storytelling is pretty surrealist as you do not know what is true; He builds tension in a very weird way"

    comments: "The concept is interesting as an idea but not really carried out that well; The plot structure is alright as the movie is split up into chapters but it does not really feel balanced; The character writing is not good as it does not really provide any depth into these characters as all of them just feel very boring"

    comments: "The dialogue is pretty forgettable; The humor is okay, but not really that amazing; The symbolism is definitely there, as the movie shares parallels with the book and the personal life of the author; The foreshadowing is pretty good"
