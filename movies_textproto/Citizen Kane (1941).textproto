    comments: "Especially the ability to make Kane look older throughout the years"
  }
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was non-linear and laid out pretty well (something that films took from in the future)"
  pacing: "Pacing was incredibly fast to the point were it was hard to follow (like if you look away for a second and you miss so much)"
  climax: "Build to climax was decent and it shows how Kane tries to seclude himself from everyone as he starts to see himself as a failure with power; climax was decent as it is more about the seclusion with more emphasis on the resolution than the climax"
  tone: "Tone was laid out well as we are trying to investigate into the life of Kane (something that may be sprung up into noir films to come)"
  final_notes: "The symbolism of the movie attached with its cinematography are something to marvel as it really was groundbreaking for the time (also it is important to note the style of storytelling and how it makes deep glimpses into the fractured life of Kane)"
  overall: "Overall, A revolutionary film that still holds up since it premiered as it incorporated many groundbreaking elements that are used by films to come as Orson Welles defines a new generation of filmmaking, even though it did run very fast to the point were it was hard to pay attention to what was going on"
