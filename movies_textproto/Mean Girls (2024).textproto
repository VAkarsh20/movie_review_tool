    comments: "The direction macroscale was kinda poor because the musical numbers were not the best choreographed and the world wasn\'t built well; the direction on a microscale felt like an imitation of the original \'Mean Girls\' movie but with a modern twist; the direction of actors was decent as most of the performances stayed true to the course (though just not as good as the original); the storytelling was decent as they used the audience\'s knowledge of the previous story and coupled with musical numbers to move to plot forward (which ultimately replaces the narration and straightforward style of the original)"

    comments: "The story is basically a musically modern retelling of \'Mean Girls\' as there are no deviations from the original plot; the plot structure was actually better as they cut out some of the unnecessary exposition and put more emphasis on the climax; flow between sequences was decent; the character writing was the same as the original (providing nothing new)"

    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The dialogue was basically a modern version of the original (with them putting more emphasis on the iconic lines); the humor was decently on par with the original (but there is less charm because it reuses a lot of the same jokes), the movie has the best joke if you combine both of the movies; the symbolism is pretty shallow and the message is pretty predictable (the movie is pretty simple in itself, so it really shouldn\'t be taken that seriously); the foreshadowing is nonexistent because the songs make reference to key points from the end (with the overall movie being just fan service)"

  pacing: "Pacing was a good pace for the whole movie (this time they fixed the pacing issues towards the end)"
  climax: "Climax was executed better this time around as they had more time to play with and had a good build-up (felt more balanced overall and ended where it should)"
  tone: "Tone is very different from the original (and this is mostly seen with them replacing the narration with musical numbers)"
  final_notes: "The marketing for this movie was a big issue because they made Regina act like the main character and barely included Cady (even though Cady still is the protagonist)"
  overall: "Overall, a mediocre retelling of an iconic movie as it feels like a musically modern imitation rather than a remake, and it does not help that the musical numbers are not that well executed"
