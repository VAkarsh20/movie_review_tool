  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was ok but really doesn\'t go anywhere"
  pacing: "Pacing was fine (could be a bit slow at times and very rushed at others)"
  climax: "The film really does not have any climax (will get to the \'twist\' in a bit), as nothing really happens (don\'t want to spoil anything but there really isn\'t any resolution)"
  final_notes: "The horror parts of the movie were very well executed and definitely showed some of M.Night\'s best work as the audience definitely is on the edge of their seat; the famous \'twist\' at the end while iconic is filled with plot holes and is can be easily picked up when watching the movie (like I did know it but still could have picked it up if I didn\'t)"
  overall: "Overall, a pretty good movie (especially for horror) that has a lot of bright moments (like Haley Joel Osment) that put me on the edge of my seat and make the movie a horror classic (putting M.Night on the map), even though it falters a lot in terms of the plot holes and lackluster moments"
