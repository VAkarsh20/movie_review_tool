    rating: "Bad"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is simple and feels like a student film; the direction on a microscale is not good as the comedic moments are forced and really not that funny; storytelling is so simple that it feels like a student film; tension is poorly executed because you really don\'t care for any of these characters, especially when something happens to them"

  overall: "Overall, a bad dumb comedy that feels like a student film"
