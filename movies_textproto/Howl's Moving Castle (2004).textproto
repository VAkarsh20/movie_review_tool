    comments: "The concept is good as the movie is a allegory for the US invasion of Iraq, though it is a bit overt at times about it; the plot structure is laid out well as the movie is pretty linear; flow between sequences is; character writing is good as you do care for these characters and what they want, especially Sophie and Howl"

    comments: "The dialogue is pretty good and standard, for English Dub; the humor keeps the movie pretty light-hearted; the symbolism is evident as the movie is a giant allegory for the US invasion of Iraw, even though it can be a bit overt at times; the foreshadowing is decently prevelant"

  overall: "Overall, a pretty good movie that uses stunning Ghibli animation to create an allegory about the US invasion of Iraq, but the movie is held back by its ending being too safe and feel-good"
