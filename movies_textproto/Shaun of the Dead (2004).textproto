    rating: "Good to Very Good"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is very good as he used a distinct style to build a satirical world on the Zombie genre; the direction on a microscale is good as the interpersonal scenes are where both the comedy and themes come out;  has a very distinct storytelling style that satirically mocks both the zombie genre while simultaneously making comments on mundane life; he builds tension in a comedic way to both elicit fear and make fun of the zombie genre at the same time"

    comments: "The concept is a nice satire on the zombie genre as it makes fun of both the genre and mundane life; the plot structure is pretty standard for a satirical horror movie; character writing is good for Shaun as it shows how Shaun feels like he is stuck in his routine of life, even though he really wants more"

    comments: "The dialogue is fresh, entertaining, and surprisingly profound for a low-budget horror satire; the humor is good as it helps move the satire forward and makes the movie funny overall; the symbolism is surprisingly present as the movie makes fun of how zombie-like the mundane, routine real world really is; the foreshadowing is good"
