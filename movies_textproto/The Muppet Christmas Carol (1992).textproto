    comments: "Pretty Good Direction (The direction of a macroscale feels very polished for a Muppets movie as the use of cinematography and the execution of musical numbers is good; the direction on a microscale is pretty standard; the direction of actors and voice actors is pretty similar to other Muppets movies; the storytelling is very similar to other retellings of A Christmas Carol (but with a Muppets twist))"

      comments: "Pretty Good from Michael Caine (I have no idea what he's doing in this movie but he does a pretty good job in both being Scrooge and singing)"
    }
    cast: "Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Pretty good singing and the puppeteering and voice acting is similar to other Muppets movies)"

    writer {
      name: "Jerry Juhl"
    }
    comments: "Decent to Pretty Good Story (The concept is just the Muppets telling 'A Christmas Carol'; the story construction just follows 'A Christmas Carol'; the flow between sequences is very meta/interjected a lot to talk to the audience (very typical of other Muppets movies); the character writing is just portraying the Muppets and Scrooge)"

  screenplay {
    writer {
      name: "Jerry Juhl"
    }
    comments: "Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue is just 'A Christmas Carol' mixed with Muppets-esque dialogue; the humor is very Muppets-esque; the symbolism is just the symbolism of 'A Christmas Carol'; The foreshadowing is just the foreshadowing of 'A Christmas Carol')"

  visual_effects: "Good Visual Effects (The use of puppeteering was really good as it showed the experience of The Muppets, the use of green screen was pretty obvious)"
  costumes: "Good Costumes (Helped set the scene for 'A Christmas Carol')"
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure followed the Christmas Carol template (but done well)"
  pacing: "Pacing was pretty fast (there isn't that much plot to go through and the runtime is pretty short)"

  tone: "Tone was a mix of 'A Christmas Carol' with The Muppets"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, it's The Muppets telling 'A Christmas Carol' (with some pretty good musical numbers)"
