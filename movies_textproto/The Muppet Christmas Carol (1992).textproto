    comments: "The direction of a macroscale feels very polished for a Muppets movie as the use of cinematography and the execution of musical numbers is good; the direction on a microscale is pretty standard; the direction of actors and voice actors is pretty similar to other Muppets movies; the storytelling is very similar to other retellings of A Christmas Carol (but with a Muppets twist)"

    comments: "The concept is just the Muppets telling \'A Christmas Carol\'; the story construction just follows \'A Christmas Carol\'; the flow between sequences is very meta/interjected a lot to talk to the audience (very typical of other Muppets movies); the character writing is just portraying the Muppets and Scrooge"
