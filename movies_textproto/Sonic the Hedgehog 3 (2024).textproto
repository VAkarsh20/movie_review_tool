      name: "Jeff Fowler"
    }
    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is pretty fun, as it creates this gaming action-comedy that is pretty true to the Sonic games; The direction on a microscale is decent, as it has the silly comedy moments Sonic is known for and tackles some darker, more mature themes that you do not see as much in a family movie; The storytelling is what you would expect from a family movie"

    comments: "The dialogue is pretty and family-oriented, but does get a little mature at points; The humor is very silly and meta, so it\'s what you would expect from both Sonic the Hedgehog and Jim Carrey; The symbolism is somewhat present as the movie touches on familial themes and loss; The foreshadowing is pretty standard because you kind of expect where this movie is going because it\'s made for families"
