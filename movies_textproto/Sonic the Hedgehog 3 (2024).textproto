    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is pretty fun as they create this gaming action-comedy that is pretty true to the Sonic games; the direction on a microscale is decent as it has the silly comedy moments Sonic is known for, and tackles some darker, more mature themes that you do not see as much from a family movie; the storytelling is what you would expect from a family movie"

    comments: "The dialogue is pretty and family oriented, but does get a little bit mature at points; the humor is very silly and meta, so what you would expect from both Sonic the Hedgehog and Jim Carrey; the symbolism is somewhat there as the movie touches on familial themes and loss; the foreshadowing is pretty standard because you kinda expect where this movie is going because its made for families"
