    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is good as it creates this menacing aura of a slasher that terrorizes his grounds, and the kills are just very detailed and grotesque that it makes the movie worth watching on this alone; the direction on a microscale is typical of low-budget horror (so very bad); the storytelling is pretty good as they do give context behind the conflict and have it motivate the killer's intentions; they build tension very well as the kills are just so grotesque and the climax goes for more psychological torture that heightens an already tense environment"

    comments: "Even though the concept is a little sterotypical, it interesting because it uses a 'wise-tale' to provide backstory into the killer, and this backstory helps shape the killer's image and actions; the plot structure is a little too elongated because it cares more about ambience than moving the story forward, and the expostion feels a lot longer than it needs to be; the character writing for the killer is good as it feels like they have created a new horror icon that rivals Leatherface and Freddie Kruger, but the writing for the rest of the cast is the typical bad horror teenager sterotype"

    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The dialogue is pretty minimal, but when it is there, it is bad; the humor is more cringy than funny; the actions create a menacing ambience that illicits fear from the persective of the killer; the symbolism is pretty minimal, but tackles themes of brutality; the foreshadowing is decent as helps paint the killer and his actions"

    comments: "The panning, and tracking shots help show the movie movie form the perspective of the killer, and do a good job at making this film be unique"

    rating: "Good"
    comments: "Some of the most detailed and unique kills as they make the movie worth watching along (especially for how low budget this movie is)"

    comments: "Does a pretty good at making making the killer look like a mythical freak"

    comments: "Helps give Johnny an iconic look"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is very slow as the movie really focuses on showing it's surroundings through long behind-the-back tracking shots of the killer walking (the movie could have been cut by 10 minutes form this alone, but this would also take away from it's aesthetic)"
  climax: "Climax is a differnt type of horror as they focus more on psychological horror rather than slasher horror (and while I did respect this, I felt it made the ending not as strong as the rest of the movie)"
  tone: "Tone is similiar to other slasher movies (especially 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre')"
  final_notes: "This movie feels like a modern-day retelling of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'"
  overall: "Overall, a slasher film that creates a new horror icon who carries out some of the most detailed kills I have ever seen, but this movie is filled with many of the typical low-budget horror issues that pull it back from being something truly iconic"
