title: "Requiem for a Dream "
rating: 9.3
review: "REDUX: (01/11/22) Great to Incredible Direction (Aronofsky is able to get memorable performances out of his actors as they are elevated through is script, use of symbolism, and unique editing and cinematography), Great Acting Overall from the main cast (Brilliant by Ellen Burstyn (delivers a career rebirth through this performance as she is able to completely transform herself into a fractured mother still looking to keep hold of his family that is fading away from her), Very Good from Jared Leto (shows promise throughout the movie was is able to handle the emotional moments very well (though does faulter at times for a bit of a newer actor), Very Good to Great from Jennifer Connelly (a performance that really helped shift her career in a different direction as she emodies an individual who is slowly being numb as she succumbs to her addictions), Good to Very Good from Marlon Waynes (a suprisingly good peformance from the known comedic actor as he steps out of his comfort zone to play his character very well), pretty bad to decent from the minor characters). Incredible Story (very well structured as we get to see how the characters slowly decline and succumb to their addictions), Great to Incredible Screenplay (Filled with great symbolism and imagery as well as great dialogue for the most part, there are some very questionable moments however), Incredible to Brilliant Score (really helped set the tone of the movie and is very iconic in its own-right), Incredible Cinematography for the most part (as we get to see the camera help give perspective to the characters, though it can be very nausiating at times), Incredible Editing for the most part (the jump cuts and the scenes where the characters are getting high are very well conducted and helped create an artsy genre for the public to see, though some of the editing choices were questionable), Good to Great sound (helped show the routine the characters went through as using the drugs just became a habit for them, though some of the sound choices were a bit cartoony and out of place), the plot structure was great as the movie is just a constant build to the climax with no resolution (something that was an intended message for the characters), pacing was extremely fast (and while this was an intention, it was still kinda made it a bit hard to follow), the build to the climax was incredible as the whole movie just builds to it, the climax itself is one of the most memorable parts of the movie as it shows how far all the characters went with their addictions and how there was no turning back anymore (something that was helped strengthened through there being no resolution), the movie is filled was incredible moments and does an incredible job with the low budget it is given but it is still filled with many flaws that showed why a movie like this was very unsuccessful went it came out (that and how grotesque it was). Overall, a must watch as Aronofsky puts himself on the mainstream map by crafting an incredible insight into the descent people go to fill the void of happiness they have as we get to see 4 characters spiral out of control through their addictions, though it is not a perfect movie as it is filled with many flaws (and not being it is nausiating and grotesque). ORIGINAL: 8.3. Very good but soooooooo fucked up. Acting was great, Screenplay was excellent, Story was excellent, Incredible Score, waaay to grotesque, jump cuts created a genre."
