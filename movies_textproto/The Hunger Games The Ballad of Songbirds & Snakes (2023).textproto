    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is good as the director uses the large sets, VFX, and cinematography to help paint these grand scenes in both the capital and the arena of The Hunger Games (while at the same time showing its grime and dark side), the direction of The Hunger Games was good and kept the movie engaging in the middle part; the direction on a microscale was bad as the interpersonal scenes did not feel fluid at all and were not well executed; the direction of actors was bad as none of of the performances felt like they were elevated by direction; storytelling was poor as there doesn\'t feel like a sense of where the movie is going as builds to one thing and drastically disposes of it in favor of a something else"

      comments: "Her accent kept on slipping and she kinda feels out of place with the rest of the cast (and the chemistry between her and Blyth is not the best); her musical moments (while forced) were carried out well as she shows off how good of a singer she is"

    comments: "The concept was pretty good as it was interesting to see the early Hunger Games and the origins of President Snow (though the carrying out of this concept was very bad); the story contruction was terrible as first act drags so much that its boring and the third act is completely out of place as it felt like they forgot to make Snow the bad guy (the second act is pretty good as its just The Hunger Games and plays to the strengths of the franchise); storytelling/flow between sequences was bad as every scene just felt forced and nothing felt like it flowed between each other (and this is especially seen in the final act as the movie has to make up for making Snow be the good guy when hes supposed to be the bad guy); character writing was very bad (Snow is terribly written as they put so much emphasis on sympathiszing him and making him be the good guy that they run out of time in making him be the bad guy and rush/force this part of the character in the end, Lucy Gray Baird is not written either as you really don\'t cate about her as her singing just gets really annoying towards the end)"

    comments: "The dialogue did not flow and was kinda forced; the tension build was good and carried out well in The Hunger Games act; the symbolism was very shallow as it does not do a good job in building Snow\'s journey for power; the foreshadowing was none-existent as the movie forces the ending because they forgot to make Snow the bad guy in the first two acts"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was the biggest issue for the movie as 2 out of the three acts were pointless (the first act builds Snow to be a good guy and really drags, the second act is pretty good as it is just The Hunger Games, and the third act is just so forced as it clearly shows that they forgot to make Snow the bad guys so they rush to give him moments that show how he\'s not a good person); The movie could\'ve been split into two movies to help with runtime (with the entire third act being spun off to show how bad of a person Snow is as there are some moments in the second act that could allude to him being a bad guy, something a second movie could take and build on)"
  pacing: "Pacing was slow in the first and third act (especially in the third) but pretty good in the second act as the fast pace helped build tension in The Hunger Games"
  climax: "Climax was so underwhelming it was more laughable than entertaining"
  tone: "Tone was very similar to other Hunger Games movies"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, a poorly executed movie as the direction and writing fail to build Snow up to be a bad guy to the point that they have to force this by the time the movie ends (making the first two acts of the movie feel pointless), but the movie is entertaining in the second act because they convey The Hunger Games well"
