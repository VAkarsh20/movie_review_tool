    comments: "A sleepover type movie with the backdrop of apocalypse mixed with different motifs on faith and judgment, though story is not what really makes the movie what it is; different callbacks to the actor\'s previous movies was fun to see"

    comments: "Given that 85% of the movie was improv, the entire movie was incredibly funny as all the jokes built off each other very nicely; Also, the biblical symbolism was a nice touch to a movie that is not meant to be taken that serious on the surface"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was very nice as each segment had its purpose in progressing the story forward"
  pacing: "Pacing was good as it kept a consistent pace (with no scenes really needed to be cut)"
  climax: "Build to climax was very typical of movies from this time (so pretty good); climax was good as it was more important in how it is revelations for the characters rather than the action present"
  tone: "Tone was set very nicely through the different motifs present as the mix of comedy/apocalypse/sleep-over/religious concepts brought something new and fun to see"
  final_notes: "The reliance on improv was fun to see as it really made the movie more about the characters interacting with each other and building jokes on each other rather than the story itself"
  overall: "Overall, an incredibly funny movie that is a masterclass in improv from some of the most prominent comedic actors of the early 2010s as we got to see how well they work with each other to make a very disastrous, fun scenario"
