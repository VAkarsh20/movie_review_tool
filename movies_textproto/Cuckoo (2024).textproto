    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good as the horror elements are laid out well (even though there are moments where he tries to do a lot); the direction on a microscale is Bad as a lot of the performances do not feel that elevated, and some of the interpersonal scenes feel kinda off/forced; the storytelling is not the best as the conflict is not really explained that well (even though they try to explain it); he builds tension well as the movie is pretty good on a horror/action scale)"

      comments: "from Hunter Schafer (Shows she has some tools to make her a good actress, but it feels like she hits an acting limit in a lot of the interpersonal/emotional scenes because her energy is off from what is needed)"

      comments: "from the rest of the cast (Some actors do have a significant impact on the movie, but some show inexperience and a lack of chemistry; the child actor does a pretty good job with what she is given)"

    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "Story (The concept is interesting but a bit convoluted as they try to explain the conflict, but its not done is a coherent way; the plot structure is decent; flow between sequences is not the best in the beginning but gets better towards the halfway point; the character writing is good as they do a good job at showing the different conflicts the protagonist are going through, as well as giving different dimensions to the antagonist and minor characters))"

    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "Screenplay (The dialogue is a little off and not that natural, but overall is decent; the humor is a bit forced, but it is fine for the most part; the symbolism is somewhat there; the foreshadowing is somewhat there, but could be better)"

    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "Visual Effects (Feels kinda tacky and low-budget, especially during the supernatural moments)"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is a bit on the slower side for most of the movie (but the movie does find a good pace towards the end)"
  climax: "Climax is executed well as it definitely was the scariest part (and it felt like all the elements were finally coming together)"
  tone: "Tone was very similar to other supernatural horror movies"
  final_notes: "Saw the International Premiere at SXSW; This movie does have tools to be a good horror movie (but it just feels like this was a test run for a very new director, I would love to see him do a follow-up where he learns from this experience)"
  overall: "Overall, a film that has the elements to be a good horror movie as everything begins to click by the climax, but the movie is held back by its convoluted concept/storytelling and mediocre performances"
