    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is very fun and playful, filled with adventure to match the movie\'s theme; the direction on a microscale is fun and playful, in a British way; the storytelling is pretty simple and straightforward; they build tension in a light-hearted way, as they try to play more at your heartstrings rather than being tense"
