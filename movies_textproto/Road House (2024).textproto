    rating: "Pretty Bad to Decent"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is good because the action sequences are well choreographed and have a unique/over-the-top style that makes the movie entertaining, and the worldbuilding/scene-setting helps highlight the Florida Keys; the direction on a microscale is bad because a lot of the performances felt off/inexperienced, and the interpersonal scenes feel so forced and rigid, but he does do a good job in setting up the comedy in the movie; the storytelling is very formulaic and emulates action movies from the 80s (so basically Road House); he builds tension somewhat well, but it definitely feels forced for the most part"

      comments: "Has good comedic timing and is a good action star in the fighting sequences, but it feels like this performance is more propelled by his acting experience rather than the material"

    comments: "The concept is super simple as it uses the same action-movie template as its predecessor (but the movie is really more about the action/fighting sequences that it really doesn\'t matter that much); the plot structure is very formulaic to the 80s action movie template; character writing is good for the protagonist as they provide some depth to his character and his trauma, but the rest of the characters are just cookie-cutter shallow characters from action movies"

    comments: "The dialogue is just so forced and bad overall because it tries super hard to emulate the over-the-top 80s, but this ends up making the movie feel unnatural; the humor is pretty good as they make an effort to inject comedy whenever they can, and it hits probably 3 out of 5 times; the symbolism is surprisingly prevalent for the protagonist as the movie touches on themes about trauma and duty, but beside that its pretty shallow; the foreshadowing is only prevalent because the movie is very formulaic/predictable"

  pacing: "Pacing is fine as the movie just follows a template"
  climax: "Climax is decent as it\'s just over-the-top action on a massive scale (still very enjoyable)"
  tone: "Tone is very over-the-top with its 80s action-style (but does a pretty good job at lightening the mood with humor)"
  final_notes: "Saw an encore screening at SXSW"
  overall: "Overall, a mindless action-remake that has an entertaining performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, well-choregraphed action sequences, and pretty good humor, but the movie is really held back by its formulaic story, bad over-the-top dialogue, and bad performances from some of the cast"
