title: "Blackkklansman"
rating: 8.0
review: "Great Acting, great story, good screenplay, funny at times, Love interest side story was not good, Preachy but its a Spike Lee movie so like that's not that surprising, The ending is extremely anticlimactic and just very bad, The end just became a PSA against Trump for like absolutely no reason, like it was not needed at all."
