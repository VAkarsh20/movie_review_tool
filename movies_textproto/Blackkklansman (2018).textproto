title: "Blackkklansman"
rating: 8.0
review: "Great Acting, great story, good screenplay, funny at times, Love interst side story was not good. Preacy but I am its a Spike Lee movie so like come on. The ending is extremely anticlimatic and just very bad. The end just became a PSA against trump for like absolutely no reason, like it was not needed at all. "
