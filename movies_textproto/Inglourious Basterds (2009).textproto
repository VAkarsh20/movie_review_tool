    rating: "Brilliant"
    comments: "The best use of subtly to build tension I have ever seen in a movie as he does so much to build suspense throughout the movie with so little; the macro-scenes are incredibly executed and the micro-scenes are done very well as the acting feels so natural between the cast (especially in the opening scene and the bar scene); moves the story incredibly well as he uses the chapter format to begin story arcs and build each piece on each other up until the climax"

      comments: "He can switch between motions so fast and effortlessly as he can switch between humor and hour in a snap; he also commands all the scenes he is in with his menacing figure, and he uses different languages to help be very persuasive in the scenes he is in"

    comments: "Uses the chapter format very well to help break up the movie into smaller pieces that build on each other as we get to see different perspectives from the war and how they converge to the climax; each chapter is also very captivating as they can be real short stories on their own with how well written and captivating they are (especially the opening and bar scene); the character writing (especially for Hans Landa) is incredible as he creates very memorable icons through the use of nicknames and actions they do; the foreshadowing of the movie is pretty prominent because the movie at the end of the day is a revenge story; there is also a lot of symmetry throughout the movie"

    comments: "The dialogue is just so iconic and memorable as it flows effortlessly between the characters and has iconic lines throughout; the jokes were very typical to other Tarantino movies (so funny and helps move the story forward); the symbolism is very present"

  }
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was very similar to Pulp Fiction in that the movie was split into chapters (and this a very good design as it helps break up the long runtime into a smaller movie as each chapter builds on each other as they all converge to the climax)"
  pacing: "Pacing was good as the movie really changed its tempo based on the scenes (it was quick when trying to progress through scenes but slow when trying to build suspense)"
  climax: "Climax was executed very well as it was very Tarantino is style and was a very captivating part to see all the storylines converge to one point"
  tone: "Tone was similar to WWII themed movies but felt very similar to other Tarantino movies in feel and style; there never really felt like just a thriller or a comedy"
  final_notes: "There wasn\'t really a score but the soundtrack was used very well to help build suspense throughout the movie; one of the best-executed uses of using tension to help build suspense I have ever seen in movies"
  overall: "Overall, a true masterclass in building suspense as we see Tarantino take control and mature as a filmmaker through his brilliant direction and incredible writing, with this this been taken control of on-screen through Christoph Waltz\'s brilliant performance as the menacing Hans Landa"
