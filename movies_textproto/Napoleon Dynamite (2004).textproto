    comments: "Pretty Good Direction (Does a good enough job in helping get the most out of his actors, even when the movie is a deadpan comedy; also, it is impressive that he was able to get the most out of the movie given such a low budget)"

    actor {
      name: "Jon Heder"
      comments: "Good to Very Good from Jon Heder (Really helps encapsulate who the titular character really is and has a lot of iconic mannerisms that make this performance iconic still to this day)"
    }
    actor {
      name: "Jon Gries"
      comments: "Good to Very Good from Jon Gries (his over-the-top, 80s nostalgic performance really helps play into the character as he is a star of the show that tries to relive memories from the past (making him the most iconic character out of all the performances))"
    }
    actor {
      name: "Aaron Ruell"
      comments: "Pretty Good from Aaron Ruell (Actually a surprisingly good performance and is a real comedic relief in the moments of deadpan, he is able to play off other characters pretty nicely)"
    }
    actor {
      name: "Efren Ramirez"
      comments: "Decent to Pretty Good from Efren Ramirez (Does not really have that much to work with as his character is more of a sidekick, but is able to still make his performance memorable)"
    }
    actor {
      name: "Tina Majorino"
      comments: "Decent from Tina Majorino (Plays a very Deadpan character who is very sheltered so she is not really able to give off that much in this performance)"
    }
    cast: "Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast"
    comments: "Decent Acting"

    comments: "Decent Story (Nothing really happens in the story (and that is kinda the point) as the movie is more about seeing Napoleon in his daily life by himself)"

  }
  costumes: "Pretty Good Costumes (the movie is filled with some iconic costumes that help play into this movie being remembered still till this day (like the Vote for Pedro shirt))"
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was kinda none-existent in it is more about Napoleon doing things and building to those different moments that Napoleon is doing (and how these events do not really have much of a resolution)"
  pacing: "Pacing was a bit on the slower side (helps add to the deadpan)"
  climax: "Build to climax was minimal but somewhat there; climax was the most iconic part of the movie but the coming down from the climax was pretty bad"
  tone: "Tone was extremely deadpan (the point)"
  final_notes: "For such a low budget movie it is very impressive what they were able to pull off with the movie and how much of a hit/iconic movie they created"
  overall: "Overall, a cult classic that is an embodiment of deadpan humor as the filmmakers really tried to get the most out of what they could from a low-budget movie, and it really shows"
