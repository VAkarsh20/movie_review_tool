    comments: "The movie is filled with some iconic costumes that help play into this movie being remembered still till this day (like the Vote for Pedro shirt)"
  }
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was kinda none-existent in it is more about Napoleon doing things and building to those different moments that Napoleon is doing (and how these events do not really have much of a resolution)"
  pacing: "Pacing was a bit on the slower side (helps add to the deadpan)"
  climax: "Build to climax was minimal but somewhat there; climax was the most iconic part of the movie but the coming down from the climax was pretty bad"
  tone: "Tone was extremely deadpan (the point)"
  final_notes: "For such a low budget movie it is very impressive what they were able to pull off with the movie and how much of a hit/iconic movie they created"
  overall: "Overall, a cult classic that is an embodiment of deadpan humor as the filmmakers really tried to get the most out of what they could from a low-budget movie, and it really shows"
