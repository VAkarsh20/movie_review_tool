title: "Bohemian Rhapsody"
rating: 6.9
review: "Incredible from Rami Malek, Band Scenes were really good but rest of the movie was kinda iffy, Incredible Music, Very Disjointed and could tell that that directors change midway through the production, Screenplay was very good at times and very shitty at times, not all the performances were great, Live Aid was incredible, editing was Terrible, for a movie that preaches identity it does not have any, the biggest what if movie of the year."
