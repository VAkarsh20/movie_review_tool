title: "We're All Gonna Die"
rating: 5.4
review: "Overall, this movie just feels as if YouTubers made a movie, which it is. The direction and writing were very similar to what youâ€™d see from 2010s YouTube videos. The acting was very forced and inexperienced. The technicals and visual effects were very similar to 2010s YouTube videos. Saw the World Premiere at SXSW."
