    rating: "Very Good to Great"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale was good as it built the world well and helped establish the tension and conflict from the trial (though the use of cinematography and editing got a bit tacky at times); the direction on a microscale was great as she brought out the emotions from her actors and helped establish the importance of every scene in helping find the truth; the direction of actors was incredible as every performance felt elevated and contributed to moving the story forward; the storytelling was great as she tells two sides of the narrative (what actually happened, and what could have happened) as they characters look for the truth"

      comments: "A true standout as she excels in all the scenes (especially in her long monologues and 1-on-1 scenes); also shows subtly to portray her as a flawed character"

    comments: "The concept was interesting as there were so many different storylines the deeper you looked into the movie (and it was intentionally a bit open-ended to make you question what really is the truth); the plot structure was laid out very well as each arc in the movie seems to have its purpose and builds to the next (though maybe a few scenes could have been trimmed); flow between sequences was good; character writing was incredible as they wrote such complex characters that you both root for and go against the more you learn about them, there were some aspects of the character writing I did not like (especially for Victor)"

    rating: "Incredible"
    comments: "The dialogue was incredible as it brought out the themes and the struggles the characters were going through; the humor was  used effectively when needed (though is as sparse as a drama would warrant); the symbolism was incredible as it is subtle yet profound because there was what happens on a surface level and what happens when you look deeper into the movie, the title in itself is symbolic and has many meanings (on the surface level and also when you look deeper); the foreshadowing was incredible as it really helps with unveiling the truth"

    comments: "Used well in a symbolic way to show the POV of different characters and show the weight of everyone\'s gaze as characters testify (though felt a bit gimmicky and tacky at times)"

    rating: "Pretty Good"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing was good as it never really felt fast or slow"
  climax: "Climax was carried out well as it was more of a vehicle for the truth to come out (rather than a big show)"
  tone: "Tone was pretty typical to courtroom dramas and European movies"
  final_notes: "There isn\'t a score but I did like how they used the soundtrack (especially PIMP) because it helps bring out the tension in the movie"
  overall: "Overall, a well-crafted courtroom drama that is carried out by the film\'s excellent writing and Sandra H\303\274ller\'s powerful performance as both create a complex character that you both support and cannot trust at the same time as the more you look for the truth, the more you question what is true"
