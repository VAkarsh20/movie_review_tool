    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "Controlled her scenes well on a macro-scale as she used the cinematography and the sets to tell how grandiose Saltburn was (and the dichotomy of how closed off everyone was because of it); Did a pretty good job on a micro scale as the one-on-one scenes were good (especially the ones between Keoghan and Elordi) but the group scenes were not that well executed; the storytelling is overall decent as the overarching story is encapsulated well but the movement between plot points is not as fluid as it could be (with there being some easily spotted continuity issues); Some scenes felt very elongated for no reason and were just really meant to shock rather than have any substance"

      comments: "Really uses his charisma and looks to help propel his performance as he really takes control of all the scenes he is in to act as this heavenly god that the main character is trying to chase"

    comments: "The overarching story is interesting and has a lot of mystery to it as the director slowly peels at what is actually going on; the storytelling is not the best as there are a lot of continuity errors (like Superbad being played on DVD before it is even out in theaters) and is not that clear at points; the characters were written well and have their clear purpose in the story (with the mystery of the lead character helping drive the story forward); There were just the right amount of plot points (it just felt like some of the overall scenes could have been cut down a bit); the movie does not tie everything up well (and this hurts the story as it is not meant to really have things left open to interpretation)"

    rating: "Decent to Pretty Good"
    comments: "The dialogue flowed very well and felt like it was of the time and the place; the symbolism is somewhat there but it does not help with portraying the message; the foreshadowing was good as it helped with showing who the main character really is (and was not that predictable)"

    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "Overall was good and helped with showing how grand Saltburn was and how small the subjects were inside it; some of the scenes felt just unnecessarily long and could have been cut to provide the same effect (especially for the more grotesque scenes)"
  }
  sound {
    rating: "Bad"
    comments: "The dialogue was not mixed well as a lot of times it was unclear what they were saying or the music was too loud that the dialogue just felt inaudible"
  }
  production_design {
    rating: "Great"
    comments: "The sets in Saltburn were just so grand and illustrious that they helped with showing the wealth the family had; the college sets were all very stunning as they helped show the history of the school; the party (and aftermath) was designed very well to just show how many people were there"
  }
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was good as the points were laid out well and each overall component helped build to the next one (it is just inside of these components it did not feel like the story progressed well between scenes)runtime could have been cut down by making some of the scenes sorter as it would not have that much effect on the story (shaving maybe 5-10 minutes)"
  pacing: "Pacing was fine as it did not feel like it was too fast or slow"
  climax: "Climax was decently executed as it is presented in a very shocking way (but the more you think about it the more holes you see in the continuity)"
  tone: "Tone was very similar to a coming-of-age mixed with a thriller and High-class British themes as this helps show the world the main character is living in"
  final_notes: "Saw a premiere at Austin Film Festival; the grotesque scenes were a bold choice but it does not pay off that well as it just makes the audience feel uneasy than actually showing how deranged some of the actions and characters were"
  overall: "Overall, a bold attempt at a grand movie in Emerald Fennell\'s sophomore effort as she really builds the grand world of Saltburn through cinematography and production design and gets a lot out of her actors (especially Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi), but, in the end, is held back by having too many continuity issues/loose ends and going overboard with the more grotesque scenes"
