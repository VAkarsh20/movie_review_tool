    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is very true to the source material as it is very silly, goofy, and cartoonish; the direction on a microscale is very much similar to other kids\' movies, but has some more mature jokes and an overall adorable feel that makes it enjoyable for adults too; the storytelling feels very similar to other Dave Pilkey properties with how silly and meta it is"

    comments: "The concept is cinema because he is a dog but he is also a man; the plot structure is pretty linear and typical of other children\'s movies as they speed through the plot in less than ninety minutes; Character writing is amazing because he is very much a dog but he has qualities that also make him a man"
