    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "Uses a more narrative style of direction to tell the story; does a pretty good job at directing the trap scenes as he elicits fear from their grotesque nature; does a decent job in the more interpersonal parts of the movie as the scenes in the exposition are pretty good, but the scenes after the halfway mark are kinda poor; gets a decent amount out of his actors as this was some of the best acting I have seen in a saw movie (though it still is far from being spectacular)"

      comments: "Feels like he knows all the ins and outs of the character as he uses his experience to carry the performance as there are multiple directions to the point that the audience feels sympathetic for John Kramer"

    comments: "Not laid out well but the movie is somewhat fresh in having more of a narrative and the climax being written well (having its signature Saw twist); incorporates many of the traditional Saw elements well and does a good job in having the traps emulate themes in Kramer\'s treatment; the writing in the exposition was good as it helped paint the backstory well (though was a bit longer than it needed to be)"

    comments: "Did have some bad dialogue but was overall fine and flowed decently (had some allusions to the original movie and does a good job in being very Saw-esque); the horror writing was good as it plays strong into what makes Saw iconic; the symbolism was present as Kramer uses the traps to be metaphors in his experience with Cancer; the foreshadowing was good as it helped lead to the twist in the end"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure biggest issue because it spends too much time in the exposition (as it could be cut by 20-30 minutes; after the halfway point the movie does a good in laying out the rest of the plot elements"
  pacing: "Pacing was decent (slower in the first half and then a bit quicker in the second (with the final 30 minutes being a good pace to help illicit fear))"
  climax: "Climax was executed pretty well (with the actual twist being displayed very well)"
  tone: "Tone was traditional to the Saw franchise (but does play a bit into being a drama)"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, a surprisingly decent Saw movie as it does a good job in being more narrative focused as the story and acting of Tobin Bell helps the audience sympathize with his struggle, and the traps and horror writing was the best it has been since the original Saw movie (though it does spend a bit too much time in the exposition and does have a lot of the same flaws that other Saw movies have)"
