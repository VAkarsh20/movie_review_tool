    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is decent, it feels like a little more polished rom-com; the direction on a microscale is good as this is where you really see the rom-com elements and the chemistry between Garfield and Pugh; the storytelling is interesting for the most part as it tells three stories from the couple\'s lives in parallel, but this storytelling style gets disregarded in the final 40 minutes and the movie goes back to being a generic rom-com"

    comments: "The concept is interesting for the most part because it looks at three arcs of a couple\'s relationship, but they disregard this concept in the last 40 minutes as they basically just focus on the present story; the plot structure follows three separate story arcs in a couple\'s relationship for the first hour, but then follows the present day storyline for the final 40 minutes; character writing is alright as the female lead has some depth to her, but overall these characters are not that memorable"

    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "The dialogue is pretty good and polished, but not that memorable; the humor is typical of other rom-coms; the symbolism is present as it revolves around this relationship and the importance of living in the moment; the foreshadowing is present in that events from the past story arcs lead into the present"

    comments: "Seems polished and helps show how the three stories are connected"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is fine for the most part as you are going through these three different timelines, but feels a bit slow in the end as they solely focus on the present-day story"
  climax: "The climax is not really that interesting as they threw away what made the movie interesting just to focus on the present day; the ending to the present day storyline was decent at best"
  tone: "Tone is very similar to other rom-coms"
  final_notes: "There really isn\'t anything in this movie that makes it memorable"
  overall: "Overall, a decent rom-com with an interesting concept and good performances from Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh; but there really isn\'t anything in this movie that makes it that memorable, especially considering they throw away this interesting concept for the last 40 minutes"
