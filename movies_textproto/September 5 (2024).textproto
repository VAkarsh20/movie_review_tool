    comments: "The direction on a macroscale fits the fast-paced, rushed guerrilla style of an inexperienced sports team breaking a terrorism event; The direction on a microscale is decent; The storytelling is good as the story and real-life events really make this movie interesting as you want to see what happens next; They use real-world events and the uncertainty of the news team covering the story to build tension well"

    comments: "The concept is good, as the movie shows the perspective of the ABC Sports team breaking the news of the Munich Massacre in real time; a group of people who don\'t have the expertise are breaking a story that the whole world wants to see in real time; The plot structure is pretty good, but the climax is a bit mishandled and the ending feels a bit anticlimactic; There isn\'t that much character writing, besides some tropes, because the movie is about the story and the news group as a collective breaking it"

    comments: "The dialogue is pretty strong; The symbolism is pretty neutral, as it does not really try to be political, as the movie cares more about the neutral American sports team breaking the story, though there is some inherent Israeli preference due to the subject matter; The foreshadowing is not the best because the movie just feels so mismanaged in the end from how it is presented"

    comments: "The guerrilla style helps heighten the tension and show the unease of the team breaking the story; the style helps make the movie feel like it was shot by an Olympic cameraman"

    comments: "Feels well-put-together and is important to helping build the tension; The movie feels like it is cut by putting film strips together in the traditional 70s way, similar to what was being done in the movie; It does a very good job splicing in real-world footage to make the movie feel seamless"

  pacing: "Pacing is pretty good; The movie uses its short runtime well; but the ending feels a bit all over the place"
  climax: "Climax is very mismanaged, especially if you know what actually happens before watching this movie; the ending feels very anticlimactic"
  tone: "The tone is very journalistic, dramatic, and mixed with thriller elements to help build tension;"
  final_notes: "I hate that this movie is pronounced \"September five\" and not \"September 5th\""
  overall: "Overall, a good movie that uses its story and editing to show the Munich Massacre from the perspective of a neutral and inexperienced ABC Sports team, but the movie fails to stick the landing because of its mismanaged climax and anticlimactic ending"
