    comments: "The most mature storytelling Nolan has ever displayed as he weaves and controls all the scenes on both a macro and micro-scale to drive the story forward to show his message; this was the Nolan has ever done in getting the most out of his actors as the acting down the cast is amazing to where there are so many actors that have their best performance with this movie; has a more palatable interpretation of his signature Nolan style as he makes the audience think but in a way that they can understand (even if another viewing is needed to provide more clarity)"

    writer {

    }
    rating: "Incredible"
    comments: "An incredibly dense story that crams many moments in Oppenheimer\'s life into the film, but uses pace and runtime to make it seem like it may be too short at points as all the story points connect and drive the narrative forward; it is also great to see that they not only spend a lot of time on the Manhattan Project but the aftermath too as that is where the real message of the movie lies; The non-linear storytelling was an homage to Nolan\'s first break Memento as it helps with showing the consequences of the Manhattan Project"

    rating: "Brilliant"
    comments: "One of the best screenplays I have ever witnessed in that the dialogue is so natural yet profound as actors can converse with each other with ease and it is embedded with symbols meant to tell the story; the symbolism is incredibly profound and some of the best I have ever seen in a movie as there are many symbols throughout the movie to help show the message it is trying to present; one of the best uses of foreshadowing I have ever seen as a second watch shows how hesitant the scientists were in creating the bomb given the implications it may have on humanity"

    rating: "Incredible to Brilliant"
    comments: "The mix of IMAX cameras with large format 70 MM cameras shows the grandeur of the operation and how larger than life the project was (as well as the aftermath); the mix of color and black-and-white help show different perspective and lenses throughout the movie"

    comments: "The cuts were incredibly fluid and some of the best work I have ever seen as they were so mesmerizing the watch on the big screen"
  }
  sound {
    rating: "Great"
    comments: "The sound editing was incredible as the sounds they used to create the explosions (and the lack of sounds at some point) help build tensions throughout the movie; the mixing of dialogue was an improvement from the previous Nolan movies but it still is an issue as there are some moments were the dialog is hard to hear"

  visual_effects {
    rating: "Incredible to Brilliant"
    comments: "Some of the best effects work I have ever seen as the use of practical effects over CGI show the capabilities filmmakers have without the use of expensive technology"

    rating: "Great"
    comments: "This is specifically for Los Alamos as they did a great job in building a makeshift town"
  }
  costumes {
    rating: "Very Good"
    comments: "The costume work for Oppenheimer is iconic and will be a big part of pop culture for years to come"
  }
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was very unique and non-linear as Nolan takes a page out of Memento to use a non-linear structure to tell the narrative (and I am a big fan of this as it helps show the effects the Manhattan project has on the future and implications it has on the scientific and American community)"
  pacing: "Pacing was incredibly fast as the movie flies by its long runtime to fit in as much story as it can (this is neither really a positive nor a negative as there is nothing that could be cut from the movie)"
  climax: "Climax was incredible as the movie really culminates to this moment (and this is done very well given how the movie jumps between time periods to help the audience holistically know the bigger picture)"
  tone: "Tone was a culmination of a war bio-pic/courtroom-drama/grand epic as Nolan uses his signature style to take the best elements of all three to help establish a very unique tone"
  final_notes: "Saw in IMAX 70 MM and it really is an experience in itself"
  overall: "Overall, a modern masterpiece that transcends the biopic as Nolan delivers a masterclass in direction, writing, and acting (with Cillian Murphy delivering a career-defining performance) as the movie is breathtaking from top to bottom with how it uses many different elements to help share its true message about the horrors of one\'s creation (and the implication it may have on the future)"
