  direction {
    director {
      name: "Alejandro Monteverde"
    }
    comments: "Bad Direction (Did not get anything out of his actors as they felt very stiff and unnatural when working off each other; the storytelling felt pretty amateurish; the use of editing and cinematography felt very amateurish; the direction of the more uncomfortable scenes was decent though)"

  acting {
    actor {
      name: "Jim Caviezel"
      comments: "Bad from Jim Caviezel (Felt incredibly over-the-top and did not really work well off of any of his other actors; did not feel like he was carrying his own throughout the movie as it was doing too much and emotionless at times)"
    }
    actor {
      name: "Mira Sorvino"
      comments: "Decent from Mira Sorvino"
    }
    actor {
      name: "Bill Camp"
      comments: "Decent from Bill Camp (While he did have his questionable moments, he held his own for the most part throughout the movie)"
    }
    cast: "Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Does not include the child actors)"
    comments: "Very Bad to Bad Acting"

    comments: "Pretty Story (The idea of the story is something that is important to tell, the main issue is many elements of this movie are embellished/fabricated (and this is obvious at many points of the movie); the movie is also incredibly predictable)"

    comments: "Terrible Screenplay (The dialogue feels incredibly unnatural and hard to listen to at times with how bad and corny it is, symbolism is very shallow (though profound))"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was very templated and pretty simplistic overall"
  pacing: "Pacing was pretty slow (could have been cut 20-30 minutes to increase the speed)"
  climax: "Climax was not that well executed because it is incredibly over-the-top and hard to believe actually happen"
  tone: "Tone was very bland overall as the direction did not do a good job in establishing it (also there are many influences of faith that are prevalent, even though this is not necessarily a bad thing)"
  final_notes: "This is an important topic to talk about but it would have probably been better off as a documentary than a movie that embellishes the truth"
  overall: "Overall, an important topic that does not hit the mark as the movie is incredibly over-the-top with its bad direction, acting, and writing as it embellishes the truth to try to bring to light the subject matter (which only hurts its credibility)"
