    comments: "Pretty Bad to Decent Direction (The direction on a grand scale was decent as he does a good job in building the magical world, but does not do as good of a job on the musical numbers as they were very cookie cutter and nothing felt spectacular; The direction on a microscale was decent as the interpersonal/dramatic scenes were pretty formulaic to other musicals; similarly, the storytelling felt very similar to other comedy musicals; the direction of actors was pretty good as no performance felt off (though the vocal performances were pretty generic as nobody stood out))"

      comments: "Pretty Bad to Decent from Timoth\303\251e Chalamet (Does a decent job holding his own as the lead but he is trying way too hard to be a \'Jim Carrey\' like character (and it is very obvious in scenes), his singing voice is pretty generic and feels like a typical NYU student)"

      comments: "Pretty Good from Calah Lane (Holds her own pretty well and works off of Chalament nicely, does a pretty good job in the musical numbers)"

      comments: "Pretty Good from Keegan-Michael Key (Basically just plays a mix of his characters from Key & Peele)"

      comments: "Pretty Good to Good from Olivia Colman (The best acting in the movie as you can tell she had to play more from experience with being a villain for the story)"

    actor {
      name: "Hugh Grant"
      comments: "Pretty Good from Hugh Grant (Does a good job for what he is called to do, but it just feels like this role is a cash grab for him)"
    }
    cast: "Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Just generic musical background actors, the singing also was pretty generic as nobody stood out)"

    }
    comments: "Pretty Bad Story (The concept was interesting as Willy Wonka\'s mysterious backstory was a question in the original story (but this intrigue is not replenished as his origin is pretty predictable and not that interesting); the story construction was fine as follows the comedy musical template; the flow between sequences is not that fluid as there is a musical number almost every 5 minutes (which hurts the plot from moving forward); the character writing is pretty shallow as they don\'t add anything to Wonka\'s character and the other characters are pretty cookie-cutter/predictable)"

    comments: "Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was incredibly corny and generic for a comedy musical; the humor was very predictable; the symbolism was pretty shallow; the foreshadowing was too overt to where the movie was incredibly predictable (which is mostly because the movie feels templated))"

  visual_effects: "Good Visual Effects (Used well with showing how vast and magical the world is (but the CGI of animals was very noticeable))"
  production_design: "Pretty Good Production Design (Helped with creating the world (but most of it felt like CGI/Green Screens))"
  makeup: "Pretty Good Makeup"
  costumes: "Good to Very Good Costumes (Made Wonka\'s costume pay homage to Gene Wilder\'s)"
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was very formulaic as it followed the musical template"
  pacing: "Pacing was all over the place as the constant interjection of musical numbers hurt the flow for the movie (especially given it a sub 2-hour movie)"
  climax: "Climax was pretty predictable and pretty underwhelming"
  tone: "Tone was very similar to other musical comedies"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, a pretty generic, formulaic musical comedy that does not execute well on either front as the writing is very predictable and the musical performances are very bland, with Chalamet\'s performance feeling more like a Jim Carrey imitation than a young Willy Wonka"
