    rating: "Pretty Bad to Decent"
    comments: "The direction on a grand scale was decent as he does a good job in building the magical world, but does not do as good of a job on the musical numbers as they were very cookie cutter and nothing felt spectacular; The direction on a microscale was decent as the interpersonal/dramatic scenes were pretty formulaic to other musicals; similarly, the storytelling felt very similar to other comedy musicals; the direction of actors was pretty good as no performance felt off (though the vocal performances were pretty generic as nobody stood out)"

      comments: "Does a decent job holding his own as the lead but he is trying way too hard to be a \'Jim Carrey\' like character (and it is very obvious in scenes), his singing voice is pretty generic and feels like a typical NYU student"

    comments: "The concept was interesting as Willy Wonka\'s mysterious backstory was a question in the original story (but this intrigue is not replenished as his origin is pretty predictable and not that interesting); the story construction was fine as follows the comedy musical template; the flow between sequences is not that fluid as there is a musical number almost every 5 minutes (which hurts the plot from moving forward); the character writing is pretty shallow as they don\'t add anything to Wonka\'s character and the other characters are pretty cookie-cutter/predictable"

    comments: "The dialogue was incredibly corny and generic for a comedy musical; the humor was very predictable; the symbolism was pretty shallow; the foreshadowing was too overt to where the movie was incredibly predictable (which is mostly because the movie feels templated)"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was very formulaic as it followed the musical template"
  pacing: "Pacing was all over the place as the constant interjection of musical numbers hurt the flow for the movie (especially given it a sub 2-hour movie)"
  climax: "Climax was pretty predictable and pretty underwhelming"
  tone: "Tone was very similar to other musical comedies"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, a pretty generic, formulaic musical comedy that does not execute well on either front as the writing is very predictable and the musical performances are very bland, with Chalamet\'s performance feeling more like a Jim Carrey imitation than a young Willy Wonka"
