    rating: "Very Good"
    comments: "It does a very good job at building the world and installing many of the elements from the books into the movies, also staying pretty true to the books; He gets the most out of his actors and does a good job in getting the joy and innocence out of the child actors;  He brings his typical light-hearted tone that he has in his other movies, but does go a bit darker sometimes due to the film\'s content"

      comments: "Does a good job at carrying the weight of the movie as he is truly the only person who could do the job of playing young Harry Potter, with his charm, naivete, and bravery; He shows more of his dramatic side as he feels more comfortable in this position and tackles darker concepts"

      comments: "Given a lesser role this time around, but still steals the scenes he is in, as his large presence, coupled with his comedic and loving nature, acts as the father figure to Harry throughout the movie"

    comments: "Filled with many iconic lines that are instantly quotable, but is pretty safe overall given that it is a light-hearted children\'s movie; the symbolism is pretty similar to that of the books; the foreshadowing helps build the rest of the franchise and who the main antagonist will be for Harry to fight; the dialogue is filled with a lot of one-liners that are truly funny"

  pacing: "Pacing is a bit on the faster side, as they really do not leave any minute unused, as they try to go through as much plot as possible from the book"
  climax: "Climax was very entertaining as it showed how Harry was \"The Chosen One\"; the action sequence with the basilisk truly is one of my favorite moments in the entire series"
  tone: "The tone was very typical of other Chris Columbus movies, as it was pretty lighthearted and family-oriented; but it does get a bit dark sometimes when it calls for it"
  final_notes: "Some bias exists as this was not only one of my favorite movies growing up as a child but my favorite Harry Potter book/movie"
  overall: "Overall, my favorite Harry Potter movie is a great adaptation of the second book of my most iconic written series of all time; with the movie carried by its visual effects, production design, costumes, score, acting, and writing, you are transported outside the realm of reality to see kids try to find their part in the Wizarding World"
