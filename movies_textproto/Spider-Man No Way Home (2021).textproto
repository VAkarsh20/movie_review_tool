    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is great as they build this visual experience that pays homage to all the generations of Spider-Men; the direction on a microscale is better than the stereotypical Marvel movie as it touches deeper themes, but is still not that much of a difference; the storytelling is pretty typical to other Marvel movies; they build tension pretty well as anticipation really drives the movie's engagement"

    comments: "The concept is good as they use the multiverse to connect all the Spider-Men toghether; the plot structure is pretty simple, but it is nice to see them pay homage and interweave the different timelines into one story; there are many plot holes given the use of spells; character writing is good as it keeps the essense of the original characters while giving them more perosnality (especially Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man)"

    comments: "The dialogue is very Marvel (but still captures the essense of all the three Spider-Man franchises); the easter-eggs in dialogue from the previous franchises were also great to see; the humor is very marvel; the symbolism is pretty profound as the the main message/theme of the movie is about second chances (seen with Peter Parker explaining this with the reason to hold the fight at the Statue of Liberty) as all three Spidermans get a second-chance at something that was taken from them (Tobey Maguire\'s Spiderman gets his second chance at saving Norman Osborn while also getting closure on his career defining role, Andrew Garfield gets his second chance at saving MJ (something he could not do with Gwen) while also redeeming himself from the failures of his franchise to show how capable of a Spiderman he really was, Tom Holland\'s Spiderman gives his second chance away to his best friend and girlfriend as he sacrifices his life so that they can succeed without him), and the movie also touches on how you cannot manipulate destiny; the foreshadowing is pretty formualic (its pretty predictably Marvel)"

    rating: "Great"
    comments: "Especially at how they were able to accent/get previous costumes from the older franchises"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing was good as the movie follows the simple Marvel formula (but it does feel a bit slow at times)"
  climax: "Climax is the best part of the movie as it shows the majority and growth of all the three Spider-Men (all while showing a grand spectical)"
  tone: "Tone is very Marvel"
  final_notes: "Incredible Casting (something I rarely comment on, but the ability to get all the previous Spider-Man actors who were not under contract (as well as the ability to keep the spoilers under wraps) is something that deserves applause in itself); the fan service of the movie is a prime example of how it should be done (it accents all the previous franchises while still showing the brilliance of the current one); it is important to also note how amazing of a cinematic experience this was as I have never seen a crowd so invested in the movie as they cheered and got on their feet for different moments (like when the different Spidermen and Daredevil were introduced, and when Andrew Garfield gets his second chance) and this movie really brought back theaters from the pandemic"
  overall: "Overall, one of the most entertaining cinematic experiences I have ever experienced as this film interweaves three different timelines well to create a redeeming spectical, but the movie has dipped a bit in rewatchablity because it's pretty formulaically Marvel and not as exiciting when you know the suprises"
