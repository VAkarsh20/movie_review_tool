  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was great as the movie was broken down effectively into parts that build on each other"
  pacing: "Pacing was very good as it uses all its scenes effectively (even though the runtime is a bit longer)"
  climax: "Build to the climax is great with the climax being the best part of the movie (it shows the maturity and growth of all the three spidermans)"
  final_notes: "Incredible Casting (something I rarely comment on, but the ability to get all the previous Spider-Man actors who were not under contract (as well as the ability to keep the spoilers under wraps) is something that deserves applause in itself); the fan service of the movie is a prime example of how it should be done (it accents all the previous franchises while still showing the brilliance of the current one); the main message/theme of the movie is about second chances (seen with Peter Parker explaining this with the reason to hold the fight at the Statue of Liberty) as all three Spidermans get a second-chance at something that was taken from them (Tobey Maguire\'s Spiderman gets his second chance at saving Norman Osborn while also getting closure on his career defining role, Andrew Garfield gets his second chance at saving MJ (something he could not do with Gwen) while also redeeming himself from the failures of his franchise to show how capable of a Spiderman he really was, Tom Holland\'s Spiderman gives his second chance away to his best friend and girlfriend as he sacrifices his life so that they can succeed without him); it is important to also note how amazing of a cinematic experience this was as I have never seen a crowd so invested in the movie as they cheered and got on their feet for different moments (like when the different Spidermen and daredevil were introduced, and when Andrew Garfield gets his second chance) and I really believe this will be the movie to bring theaters back from the pandemic"
  overall: "Overall, a defining comic-book movie that is filled with action, humor, and sadness as we get to see some familiar faces get second chances and get the closure they never got with both their characters and their careers"
