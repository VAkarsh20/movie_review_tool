    rating: "Very Bad to Bad"
    comments: "The use of storytelling was lackluster as it was very anti-climatic the way the multiple storylines converged; the meta humor felt very childish as it felt more cheap than funny; did not get anything from the actors as it did not feel like they were playing off each other at all"

      comments: "The only somewhat memorable performance from the movie as it felt like she was holding her own solely from the experience she has and not from any direction given"

      comments: "Felt like he was playing the similar character he has been playing since Straight Outta Compton as it is pretty one-dimensional (though does have some charm and humor at times)"

    comments: "Uses parallel storytelling to tell three different stories but does a pretty bad job at having them all converge at the end; the conflict was poorly introduced and poorly resolved; the ending is also incredibly predictable"

    comments: "The dialogue felt very forced and corny, the jokes were not that funny at all as it felt more childish and shocking than actually telling something funny, very shallow overall in terms of symbolism and message"

  }
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was pretty simplistic as it just followed the template of having multiple storylines converge to a climax at the end (nothing that hurts or adds to the film)"
  pacing: "Pacing was pretty fast as it tries to tell three different stories at once (and has a very short runtime to do so)"
  climax: "Climax was decent (but the dialogue was a bit corny and the ending was pretty predictable)"
  tone: "Tone was very similar to other horror comedies (though it tries a lot to be more in the realm of comedy as it tries to make so many jokes (its just none of them are that funny))"
  final_notes: "The best/funniest thing about this movie is the title"
  overall: "Overall, a movie that has no redeeming qualities at all as it is poorly written, not funny, and not that well directed as the only thing that is memorable about this movie, in the end, is the title"
