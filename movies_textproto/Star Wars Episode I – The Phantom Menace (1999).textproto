rating: 6.6
review: "Acting by the veteran actors was good (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor especially, Samuel L Jackson, and Yoda), the acting by those who are not experienced were either pretty bad or very bad, Direction was horrible, Story was great, Screenplay was terrible, Visuals were really good, Score was incredible, Production Design was great, Film aged better than most would have thought, Pacing was really off in the first half."
