title: "13th"
rating: 7.9
review: "Very informative in the first 2/3 of the movie, great historical context and presentation, graphics and editing was very good for this part of the doc, general narrative was consistent and explained the message, final 1/3 of the movie just turned into anti-trump propaganda and a pro-hilary message, cuts were very biased at this point in the film. In the end very informative in the overall message of the film."
