title: "The Other Guys"
rating: 9.4
review: "REDUX: (04/09/22) Very Good Direction (Was able to blend the comedic and action elements very well), Good to Very Good Acting Overall (Incredible Chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlburg as both actors\' strengths come out when working off each other, Great Performance from Michael Keaton (Really steals the show in his over-the-top nature), Good from Steve Coogan, Good to Very Good from The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson (In their very brief roles), Pretty Good to Good from everyone else)), Great Story (At its core the movie is pretty surface level in that cops are trying to make a break for themselves, but the typical Adam McKay and Will Ferrell story elements really make different elements of the story funny), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (One of the funniest movies I have watched due to the quotable jokes and how stereotypical of a Will Ferrell movie this is), Good Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Good Visuals. Plot Structure was very nice and laid out well, Pacing was good as it kept a consisent pace (with no scenes really needed to be cut, but some of the deleted scenes were very funny), the build to climax was very typical of movies from this time (so pretty good), climax was good (A generic mix of 2000s action with comedic elements), tone was set very nicely as it followed the action comedy template very nicely. Overall, an incredibly funny movie that is incredibly quotable and a must watch for the jokes and the chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlburg as it is a pillar in the buddy cop genre that began to take over the early 2010s. ORIGINAL: 8.4. Hilarious, Great Story, Great Chemistry,"
