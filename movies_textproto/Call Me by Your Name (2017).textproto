title: "Call Me by Your Name"
rating: 6.4
review: "Very Conflicting Movie. For the first 1.5 Hours: Extremely Boring, Alright Screenplay, OK Story, Acting very boring except for Armie, Good song selection. For Last 30 Min: Incredible Acting, Incredible Screenplay, Incredible Story, Incredible Song Selection. This movie is one that is very touching and very good at the end but is murdered due to the fact that the beginning 3/4 of the movie is so bad."
