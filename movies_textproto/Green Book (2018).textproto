title: "Green Book"
rating: 8.3
review: "The definition of a movie that almost checks every box but does not go above and beyond in any way. Great acting, Great story, decent screenplay, good music, great mix of humor and drama. The movie has great concepts but the screenplay could be retweeked a little bit to make it better."
