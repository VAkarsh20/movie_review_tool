    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "On a macro scale, Reeves did a Great job in setting the tone and laying out the different concepts he wanted from the movie, but on a micro scale, it felt like some of the conversations were not fluid and it felt like a lot of the pieces did not connect"

      rating: "Good"
      comments: "He embodied the Batman role very well as you could tell how committed he was to playing the capped crusader (though physically it seemed he did not work out for it); though, he was not that convincing as Bruce Wayne (a big issue with the movie)"

      }
      rating: "Good to Very Good"
      comments: "For the first 3/4 of the movie it felt like he was really stealing the show, but the final 1/4 of the movie, his performance really falls apart from being the menacing serial killer he is and to becoming a discord mod"

    comments: "The symbolism was prevalent and very well executed in showing its importance, though the dialogue felt very forced and not natural at all"

    composer {
      name: "Michael Giacchino"

    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "Felt this was kind of a miss from the movie was it felt like the same motif playing over and over again and really takes a back seat to the iconic scores from the previous Batman movies"

    rating: "Great"
    comments: "The shift between general shots and reaction shots in the action scenes was a good stylistic choice, and the overall general shots taken was executed very well, but the intentional blur was a bit questionable at points"

  costumes {
    rating: "Very Good"
    comments: "With the Serial Killer-esque Riddler Costume being the best, Batman had a very realistic costume"
  }
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was fine for the first 3 acts but as soon as the it starts to get close to the climax (final 1/4 of the movie) it really starts to fall apart with the ending being kinda pointless and a bit boring"
  pacing: "Pacing felt good for the most part but for the final third of the movie it really hits how slow and dragging it is (Could have definitely cut 30-40 mins of the movie)"
  climax: "Build to climax not good as it feels like (SPOILER ALERT) as the interrogation scene is a bit pointless with nothing being added to the story except for the fact that (SPOILER ALERT) the riddler still won; climax was pretty boring as there were moments in the actual fight scene where it felt like Batman took very questionable moves (Also it just felt like Batman was fighting a bunch of Discord/Reddit mods)"
  tone: "Tone was set very nicely as it felt very dark and very Neo-Noir esque in its presentation and dialogue"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, a movie that has the potential to set up a good new Batman film series but suffers from a lot of flaws in its first encounter; it will be interesting to see where we are taken next as we follow this new, darker version of Batman"
