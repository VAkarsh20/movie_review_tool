title: "Gully Boy"
rating: 8.6
review: "Movie really picks its place and hits its stride after the second half. The acting is very good and the chemsitry between the leads is definitely noticable. The music is like not my type of rap but I mean I can\'t be mad. Has inspirations from 8 mile but is unique in its own right."
