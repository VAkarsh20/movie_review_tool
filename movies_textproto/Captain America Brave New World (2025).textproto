    }
    rating: "Bad"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is very formally marvelous, specifically Winter Soldier, but I did enjoy most of the action sequences; the direction on a microscale is very cringey and forced Marvel humor; the storytelling is very shallow and forced; they build tension poorly; it is very evident that multiple reshoots were done for this movie because there was no clear vision they were going for"

      comments: "It does not do a good job filling the shoes Mackie left open, but this is mainly because its dialogue is pretty bad; it has okay chemistry with Mackie"

    comments: "The concept is just a rehash of \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" with a loophole sequel to \"The Incredible Hulk\"; the plot structure is very straightforward and linear; character writing is bad because none of these characters have depth; They try to make Ross this \"Trump-like\" character, but give him sympathy, and they try to introduce doubt about Sam Wilson as the new Captain America, but this was already addressed in the TV show and it doesn\'t really go anywhere in this movie"

    comments: "The dialogue is very bad and cringey, it is as if AI wrote this movie; the humor is forced and does not hit most of the time; the symbolism is not focused because they try to make this movie an allegory for the current presidential regime, but they give up on this halfway through the movie; the movie also tries to introduce character doubt, but they give up on this as well; the foreshadowing is bad because they just force plot points as you just have to expect things are going to happen because of the current track record of Marvel"

  pacing: "Pacing is very slow because the movie just does not know what direction it is going in, and the writing is so bad that you wonder why you are even watching this movie"
  climax: "Climax is very anticlimactic, as the final fight scene is not really that well executed"
  tone: "The tone is very Marvel, but because of the constant reshoots, the movie feels like it has no direction"
  final_notes: "The fight scenes were pretty well executed and entertaining, but that was really the only entertaining thing about this movie; it was very obvious this movie went through constant reshoots as there was no real direction they were going for"
  overall: "Overall, a bad movie because it was clearly obvious that this movie went through constant reshoots since there was no clear direction for what they were trying to go for, symbolizing the current track record for Marvel"
