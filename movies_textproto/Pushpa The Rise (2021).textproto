    comments: "The concept is pretty interesting as it is a character based movie that follows his hero's journey; the plot structure is pretty standard for a hero's journey movie, but the ending feels a bit unnecessary; character writing is good for Pushpa as this movie creates a very iconic character to start this character-driven action franchise"

    comments: "The dialogue is filled with a lot of iconic dialogue that makes this a blockbuster action movie; the humor is pretty good as it interjects the movie's seriousness to make this a unique movie; the symbolism is decently prevelant as the movie talks about themes like family and the importance of your name; the foreshadowing is decent"

    comments: "Used the nature landscape very well and captured the essence of the South Indian forest"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is on the slower side as it feels like the story is dragging a little bit"
  climax: "Climax is a little unnecessary, as they added a new storyline with like 20 minutes left in the movie; this new storyline has nothing to do with the original storyline and is more for building up the sequel"
  tone: "Tone is very action-Tollywood"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, a character-driven action Tollywood movie that is carried by pretty good writing and a good performance from Allu Arjun to create this iconic character, Pushpa; the story does feel a bit bloated as the final 20 minutes really do not have anything to do with the original story"
