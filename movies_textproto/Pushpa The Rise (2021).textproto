    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is a well-executed, over-the-top action movie, like those seen in other Tollywood movies; The direction on a microscale is decent; The storytelling is decent; He builds tension in a way very much on par with other Telugu movies"

    comments: "The concept is pretty interesting, as it is a character-based movie that follows his hero\'s journey; The plot structure is pretty standard for a hero\'s journey movie, but the ending feels a bit unnecessary; Character writing is good for Pushpa, as this movie creates a very iconic character to start this character-driven action franchise"

    comments: "The dialogue is filled with a lot of iconic dialogue that makes this a blockbuster action movie; The humor is pretty good as it interjects the movie\'s seriousness to make this a unique movie; The symbolism is decently prevalent as the movie talks about themes like family and the importance of your name; The foreshadowing is decent"

  pacing: "Pacing is on the slower side as it feels like the story is dragging a little bit;"
  climax: "Climax is a little unnecessary, as they added a new storyline with about twenty minutes left in the movie; this new storyline has nothing to do with the original storyline and is more for building up the sequel"
  tone: "Tone is very action-oriented, Tollywood"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, a character-driven action Tollywood movie that is carried by pretty good writing and a good performance from Allu Arjun to create this iconic character, Pushpa; the story does feel a bit bloated as the final 20 minutes really do not have anything to do with the original story"
