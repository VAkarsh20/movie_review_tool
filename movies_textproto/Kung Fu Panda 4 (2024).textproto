    comments: "Direction (The macroscale is very good as they once again take a simple plot and make the most out of it, going above and beyond with more advanced visuals and grand fighting scenes; the microscale is pretty good as the interpersonal momenets felt very similiar to the other movies in the franchise, but the movie is less deep this time around as they try more to entertain rather than finding personal messages; the storytelling is very similiar to other children's movies, and while it is different this time around by have multiple storylines, this makes the movie more shallow)"

    comments: "Story (The concept is kinda forced this time around as it feels like an unnecessary story (even though they do carry it out well); the plot structure is laid out well as it does not try to overcomplicate the story (has one simple conflict and uses its short runtime to resolve this); flow between sequences is good; character writing is pretty good as they do a good job in showing the dimensions of the other characters, but it really feels like they did not give Po as much depth this time around)"

    comments: "Screenplay (The dialogue is pretty sharp for a children's movie, but there are some forced lines; the humor is good for the most part, but is really geared towards children more this time around; the symbolism is more forced than present as the movie is pretty shallow in its message; the foreshadowing is more predictable this time around as you know where the movie is going within the first 10 minutes)"

    rating: "Very Good to Great"
    comments: "Visual Effects (The most polished film in the franchise as they seamlessly incorporate different animation styles and do a great job in bringing to life the world and the fighting scenes; the visual effects are held back a bit because a lot of the new character designs feel very similiar to 'Zootopia')"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing was very good for its short runtime as every scene felt intended and the right length"
  climax: "Climax is executed well as it shows off the film's animation excellence as well as the display the message/ close the storyline they intended to have in this movie"
  tone: "Tone feels more like a children's movie this time around as they really try to force laughs and please the younger audience"
  final_notes: "The movie just feels unnecessary and does not really provide anything worth towards Po's character arc"
  overall: "Overall, a pretty good installment in the franchise as the film is animated very well and has noticable voice acting performances, but the movie is not as strong as the first three because its tailored more towards children and feels like a cash grab"
