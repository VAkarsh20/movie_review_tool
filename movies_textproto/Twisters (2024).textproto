    director {

    }
    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is good because the disaster moments are well executed and use tension and fear to make the movie engaging; the overall world-building is pretty formulaic; the microscale is decent as the performances are fine and decently acted; it is just very limited by a bad script; the storytelling is pretty simple and formulaic; they build tension well as the whole movie is built on its tense, disaster moments"

      comments: "Plays the lead pretty well and shows a pretty good range of emotions; but her performance is a bit limited at times and her accent keeps throwing me off"

      rating: "Pretty Good"

      }
      rating: "Decent"
      comments: "He does a decent job with what he is given, as he has good chemistry with Edgar-Jones and shows some emotion; however, he is just given the worst lines in the movie, so it is not really his fault"

    rating: "Bad"
    comments: "The concept is just a rehash of the first movie; the plot structure is pretty formulaic; character writing is pretty good for Edgar-Jones\' character but pretty shallow for the rest; they could have done a lot more with Powell\'s character"

    rating: "Very Bad"
    comments: "The dialogue is very bad and borderline laughable; the humor is somewhat used, but it is more unintentionally funny; the symbolism is somewhat prevalent as it deals with trauma and loss, but in a somewhat formulaic way; the foreshadowing makes the movie very predictable"
