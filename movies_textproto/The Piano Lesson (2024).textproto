    }
    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale feels very amateur and not that well executed; the direction on a microscale is fine as it mimics other August Wilson movies in that it allows the actors to act with minimal intervention, similar to a play; the storytelling is a bit muddy as they did not know what tone they wanted to go with throughout the movie; tension is not built that well because they try to force this horror, ghost story that is not that well executed"

    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "The concept deviates from the original play and makes the movie an unnecessary supernatural ghost story, which kind of hurts the story dealing with the generational trauma from their ancestors; the plot structure is nothing special; the character writing is not that great because they keep introducing many characters and do not do a good job providing them backstory to make you root for them, except for maybe Deadwyler\'s character"

    rating: "Good"
    comments: "The dialogue is very authentic to the source material and other August Wilson works; the humor is pretty true to other August Wilson works; the symbolism is profound as the whole movie deals with generational trauma this family has dealt with from slavery and racism; the foreshadowing is present but kinda expected"

    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "Used decently well throughout the movie; for a movie called \'The Piano Lesson\' it would have been great to have at least heard one piano motif throughout the movie, so not having this feels like a wasted opportunity"

  pacing: "Pacing is pretty slow as it tries to mimic the play\'s pacing"
  climax: "Climax is chaotic and poorly executed; the ending felt very anticlimactic"
  tone: "Tone is a big issue for this movie because there never felt like there was a consistent tone as they tried to make this movie both a historical drama and a ghost story; they tried to do a lot of things and couldn\'t do any of them well"
  final_notes: "Saw premiere at the Austin Film Festival"
  overall: "Overall, a film very similar to other August Wilson works, as it uses authentic dialogue and good acting, especially from Danielle Deadwyler, to tell a profound story; but the movie is held back by its amateur filmmaking and inconsistent tone"
