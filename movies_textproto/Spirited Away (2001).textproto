    comments: "Good Story (The world and characters Miyazaki creates really area iconic as many have become staples in pop-culture/when referring to Japanese animation; while the scenes and plot points themselves are good, the construction of the story kinda holds it back because it feels like it does not leave enough time to have a strong climax (spending a lot of time in setting up the characters and the world))"

    comments: "Good Screenplay (The dialog flows very nicely; the symbolism very profound with its messages being very noticeable; the foreshadowing is prevalent and does a good job in weaving into the story as a whole)"

      name: "Joe Hisaishi"

    comments: "Incredible Score (So somber yet so beautiful as the piano is interpolated throughout the movie to show feelings of loneliness and hope)"

  visual_effects: "Great Visual Effects (Really was revolutionary for the time and really helped build a 3D world from 2D animation)"
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was a major issue for the movie as it spends a little too much time in the exposition and rising action to where the climax and falling action are really breezed through (The movie as a whole just feels way too short as I would have loved to see 20 minutes added to the climax)"
  pacing: "Pacing was a tale of two movies as the first half was a bit on the slower side with the second have being very fast to catch up (an increased runtime could have balanced this out)"
  climax: "Climax was very underwhelming as it is incredibly short and just feels very forced (an increased runtime would have really helped with this)"
  tone: "Tone was established very well as it shares many of the same themes of Japanese animated movies but still has a coming-of-age/supernatural feel with its subject mater"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, an iconic movie that brought Japanese animation to the western world on a grand scale as the iconic story and direction really tell a compelling narrative, but it is held back by its runtime as it spends a bit too much time on the exposition and rising action to where the climax feels incredibly rushed and the movie closes a bit anticlimactically (something 20 minutes of extra runtime could have helped)"
