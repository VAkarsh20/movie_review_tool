    comments: "The direction on a macroscale cultivates a very silly, action-comedy that is overall entertaining; the direction on a microscale is very silly, and this is where the comedy comes out; the storytelling is a bit convoluted because they try to have too many twists to make the movie somewhat parody, but it ends up just making the movie more confusing"

    comments: "The concept is very silly and goofy, as it mixes a light-hearted idea like Game Night with Espionage; the plot structure is fine for the most part, but the ending gets a bit convoluted with all the intentional twists and turns; character writing is is funny for Jesse Plemons character because he is just someone who really wants to be in Game Might"

    comments: "The dialogue is very silly and dumb, but that's what makes it funny because there are many memorable moments; the foreshadowing is a little all over the place because the movie tries to subvert our expectations with many twists, but it ends up making the movie more convoluted"
