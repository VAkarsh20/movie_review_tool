    comments: "The direction on a macroscale feels very similar to other noirs from this time period, mixed with elements from urban westerns; the microscale is the direction of actors is pretty good and similar to other films in noirs and gritty crime movies; direction really highlights the magnitude of Clint Eastwood as an action star; storytelling is clear and interesting as it keeps on heightening the stakes of the conflict; they build tension well as it is a key element in heightening the stakes of this noir"

    comments: "The concept is iconic as it places the protagonist in an \"urban western\" as he tries to fight for justice based on his own morals; the plot structure is pretty similar to other noirs and westerns, creating the idea of the \"urban western\"; the character writing is great as they created the iconic Dirty Harry who is the last of his kind as he controversially fights for what he believes is right, blending the ideals of the gunslinger with the rogue detective"

    comments: "The dialogue is good, as it is gritty and iconic, creating some of the most memorable lines in action cinema; the humor is good, as it helps lighten the tone; the symbolism is surprisingly profound, as the movie deals a lot with doing what is right, even if it is against the law; the foreshadowing is good, as it shows how much Harry will fight to do what is right"
