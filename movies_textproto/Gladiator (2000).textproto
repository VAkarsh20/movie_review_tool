    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is very good and grand as he captures the essessne of the Roman Empire and gladiator fights, making this movie a memorable epic; the direction on a microscale is pretty standard for a period epic set in this time period; the storytelling is good for a roman epic; they build tension pretty well"
