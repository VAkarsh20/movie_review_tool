    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is very good and grand as he captures the essence of the Roman Empire and gladiator fights, making this movie a memorable epic; The direction on a microscale is pretty standard for a period epic set in this time period; The storytelling is good for a Roman epic; They build tension pretty well"

    comments: "The dialogue has iconic lines, but is pretty clunky and similar to other Roman period films; The symbolism is pretty overt, as the movie is about vengeance and ethical decisions; The foreshadowing is good, as the movie interjects the ending to show what the story is moving towards"
