title: "Casino Royale"
rating: 9.1
review: "Very good Acting overall (Really liked the Acting from Daniel Craig, Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, and Judi Dench as I thought they were great), Great Direction, Great Screenplay (Both for its wit and its dialogue overall), Very Good story (Some Major plot jumps though that I was not a fan off), Action scenes were well choreographed, The pacing of the movie was fine but I felt that the movie was really rushed in the final 1/3 because it spent too much time on the first half development/exposition that the ending was very rushed and jumped around. Overall, a great exposition story for the origins of bond and set up a great bond portrayal by the best bond, Daniel Craig."
