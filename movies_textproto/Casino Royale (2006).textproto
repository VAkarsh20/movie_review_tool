title: "Casino Royale"
rating: 9.1
review: "Very good Acting overall (Really liked the Acting from Bond, Mads, Eva, and Judi as I thought they were great), Great Direction, Great Screenplay (Both for its wit and its dialogue overall), Very Good story (Some Major plot jumps though that I was not a fan off), Action scenes were well chorographed, The pacing of the movie was fine but I felt that the movie really rushed the final 1/3 while spent too much time on the first half development/exposition that the ending was very rushed and jumped around. Overally, a great exposition story for the origins of bond and set up a great bond portayal by the best bond, Daniel Craig."
