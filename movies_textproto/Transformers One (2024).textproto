    director {
      name: "Josh Cooley"
    }
    rating: "Pretty Bad to Decent"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is decent, as the world-building and action sequences are well choreographed, but the other aspects felt kind of flat and bland; the direction on a microscale feels kind of bland, as the relationships feel very surface level, but the comedic moments were decently executed; direction of voice actors was very bland; the storytelling is pretty linear and safe overall"

      comments: "Really does not feel like the character and does not sound convincing as Optimus Prime; it felt like he was doing a minor American inflection with little emotion"

      comments: "Fine in the more comedic, friendly scenes, but he does not have that large of a range of emotions and does not do a good job showing the anger of Megatron"

      rating: "Decent to Pretty Good"
      comments: "The only positive vocal performance in the movie as he uses a very similar style to his \"Toad\" character in the Mario movie to act as the friendly, comedic relief"

    cast {
      rating: "Bad"
      comments: "More for the main cast, but this movie is a prime example of the problem you get when you hire A-list actors to do voice roles instead of voice actors; they tried to fill this cast with A-list actors so that it can sell this movie, but it really should just use the IP to sell this movie instead"

    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The concept feels very true to the Transformers story and series; I just thought it was uninteresting; the plot structure is very linear and straightforward; character writing tries to establish these relationships and backstory for these important Transformers; I just thought it was very shallow and bland"

    comments: "The dialogue is pretty simple and predictable; the humor is surprisingly good as they use a lot of physical comedy to tell jokes; the symbolism is pretty surface-level and cliche; the foreshadowing is pretty overt as the movie is very predictable"

    comments: "Definitely feels like Michael Bay had some involvement in this movie, as it helps personify the Transformers and the action sequences"

  animation {
    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "More of a personal preference, but I did not like the animation style; I thought the world and the action sequences had good animation, but the character design and the less intense scenes look uninspiring"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is pretty good"
  climax: "The climax is well executed, as the fight sequences were well choreographed and the story was engaging"
  tone: "The tone is kind of a mess as the movie does not know what audience to appeal to; it is trying to appeal to an older demographic that are fans of Transformers through references and swearing while simultaneously trying to appeal to children through tone and jokes"
  final_notes: "This movie is a prime example of just using voice actors instead of A-list actors because you should just let the IP sell the movie"
  overall: "Overall, a movie with some well-executed action sequences and funny moments, but it is a prime example of how you don\'t need an A-list cast to market this movie; the IP will market this movie, and instead, you should use a talented voice actor-led cast"
