    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is decent as the world-building and action-sequences are well choreographed, but the other aspects felt kinda flat and bland; the direction on a microscale feels kinda bland as the relationships feel very surface level, but the comedic moments were decently executed; direction of voice actors was very bland; the storytelling is pretty linear and safe overall"

      comments: "Fine in the more comedic, friendly scenes, but he does not have that large of a range of emotions and does not do a good job showing the anger of Megatron"

      comments: "The only positive vocal performance in the movie as he uses a very similiar to style to his 'Toad' character in the Mario movie to act as the friendly, comedic relief"

    cast {
      rating: "Bad"
      comments: "More for the main cast, but this movie is a prime example of the problem you get when you hire a-list actors to do voice roles instead of voice actors; they tried fill this cast with a-list actors so that it can sell this movie, but it really should just use the IP to sell this movie instead"

    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The concept feels very true to the Transformers story and series, I just thought it was uninteresting; the plot structure is very linear and straightforward; character writing tries to establish this relationships and backstory for these important Transformers, I just thought it was very shallow and bland"

    comments: "The dialogue is pretty simple and predictable; the humor is suprisingly good as they use a lot of physical comedy to tell jokes; the symbolism is pretty surface level and cliche; the foreshadowing is pretty overt as the movie is very predictable"

  animation {
    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "More of a personal preference, but I did not like animation style; I thought the world and the action sequences had good animation, but the character design and the less intense scenes looks uninspiring"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is pretty good"
  climax: "Climax is well executed as the fight sequences were well choreographed and the story was engaging"
  tone: "Tone is kinda mess as the movie does not know what audience to appeal to (its trying to appeal to an older demographic that are fans of Transformers through references and swearing while simulationously try to appeal to children through tone and jokes)"
  final_notes: "This movie is a prime example just using voice actors instead of a-list actors because you should just let the IP sell this movie"
  overall: "Overall, a movie with some entertaining moments, but is a prime example of how you don't need an a-list cast to market this movie, the IP will market this movie and you should just use a talented voice actor led cast instead"
