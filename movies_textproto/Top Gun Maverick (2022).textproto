    rating: "Very Good to Great"
    comments: "Handles the action scenes very well through direction of actors and camera angles and handles the non-fighting scenes very well as he is able to get the most of his actors as they get into their characters"

      rating: "Very Good"
      comments: "Carries where he left off from his original portrayal of the character but provides more depth into a very shallow character initially; really shows the growth in Tom Cruise\'s ability as while he does play his typical character, he has more range in what he can do with what he is provided"

    comments: "Something that the first movie has over this as everything that is new just is not as good as the original, but they do use a good amount of the original\'s material (making it nostalgic)"

    comments: "Especially in the fighter pilot scenes as the POV shots really are well made to show the pilot\'s reactions along with their surroundings, also the different angles used to help show emphasis were a nice touch"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was pretty standard (mostly follows the original with some touches every now and then) but does put balance on the most important parts of the movie (especially towards the end)"
  pacing: "Pacing was great for the most part as it was steady and helped keep the audience engaged"
  climax: "Build to climax was great as it helps build the tension that Maverick has throughout the movie and how much he really does trust and care for Rooster (something that really builds throughout the movie); climax was incredible as the final 40 minutes of the movie are incredibly captivating with the action/fighter pilot scenes and other parts (really is a must watch with its execution as well and is by far the best part of the movie)"
  tone: "Tone is pretty nostalgic overall as it is Maverick looking back at trauma he has faced and trying to make this right this time (so kinda a redemption style movie)"
  final_notes: "One of the best legacy sequels I have ever watched as it plays the line between alluding back to the original while still providing something new very well (making this movie also way better than the first)"
  overall: "Overall, a great action movie that is far better than the original as it builds off of the first movie very well through its well executed action/fighter pilot scenes and improved personal scenes, making this legacy sequel a must watch to relive old memories created from the original movie"
