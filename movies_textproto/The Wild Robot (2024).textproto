    rating: "Pretty Good to Good"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is good as they build the vast wilderness and use chase and action sequences to show how beautiful and lively it is; the direction on a microscale is very good as the interpersonal moments show the mother-son relationship between the two leads and how Roz develops a friendship with the rest of the animals, especially Fink, despite initially not having any feelings; the storytelling is pretty good as they use emotion a lot to drive the story forward, it\'s just they kinda mismanage the story they want to tell in the final 40 minutes; they use emotions to build tension as you start to build a connection to these characters, especially the main three"

      comments: "Shows a pretty good shift from being a monotonous robot to a mother with feelings, but the role only gives her so much to play with"

      comments: "Plays the \"comic relief\" character decently well and has pretty good chemistry with Nyong\'o, but does not really feel like he adds that much to the movie"

      }
      rating: "Decent"
      comments: "Plays the teenage role well as he represents puberty and the feelings that come with it, especially feeling like an outcast and not wanting to be with his family;  he does hit noticeable limits when it comes to some of the deeper moments"

    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The concept is pretty interesting as it uses the concept of the robot adapting to the wilderness to touch on complex issues like humanity, mortality, familial relationships, and adolescence; the plot structure is not the best as the movie really builds to this emotional moment towards the middle of the movie, and after the moment, it feels like the movie\'s emotional energy drags on as it builds to the climax; the character writing is good as Roz is well written to show how the morally neutral robot starts to develop feelings and humanity the more she cares for Brightbill, and Brightbill is written pretty well to serve as a symbol of adolescence and trying to fit in"

    rating: "Good"
    comments: "The dialogue is emotionally charged and pretty good for the most part, though there are some bland and questionable lines, like when she says she\'s \"A Wild Robot\" ; the humor is pretty good as it is surprisingly dark for a family movie ; the symbolism is profound as the movie talks about issues like morality, humanity, mortality, adolescence, trying to fit in, and mother-son relationships ; the foreshadowing is good and helps tie the movie together in the end"

  animation {
    rating: "Very Good"
    comments: "Really enjoyed how the movie carries this polished animated style that DreamWorks has been putting out as it makes the movie feel rough, hand-drawn, and unique"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is an issue for this movie as it is a good pace in the first 20 minutes, it jumps to the future and slows down, then even slows down some more after that; the issues with the pacing stem from the plot construction"
  climax: "Climax is decent, but I just felt very emotionally drained from the middle point of the movie that the build to the climax and the climax itself did not feel fulfilling"
  tone: "Tone feels like an animated movie that has many flavors in common with coming-of-age movies"
  final_notes: "This movies does a very good job at playing with your emotions as you really do connect with these characters"
  overall: "Overall, DreamWorks takes a positive step as I admire their unique animation style and the way the filmmakers address complex themes of morality, relationships, and adolescence through emotionally charged storytelling; but I feel that it is really held back by its plot construction, as the movie has such an cathartic climax towards the middle point of the movie that the actual climax does not feel as fulfilling"
