title: "We Are Columbine"
rating: 4.8
review: "Very Poorly made documentary, Literally is just about like 5 people and where they were during the events, barely actually goes into the details of the events or the killer, does a bad job about talking about the aftermath, Very cringy lines and fake edgy from the interviewee and were just boring. Overall, this was a very boring documentary and the whole thing could be condensed down to 10 minutes and it would still be bad."
