  story {
    writer {
      name: "George Lucas"
    }
    rating: "Incredible"
    comments: "The actual structure and storyline was very well told cause it really bridges the descent Anakin has in being the chosen one to falling to the darkside through the illusion that it will help Padme (especially really shown in the final hour)"

    writer {
      name: "George Lucas"
    }
    rating: "Bad"
    comments: "To where it is memorable and iconic; None of the language was natural and felt very forced (but there are just so many memorable lines from how bad they were written that I loved it; the foreshadowing and symbolism actually is told very well (giving further proof that Lucas is a good Storyteller but terrible dialogue writer))"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was laid out very nicely as all the elements really built off of each other and every element played an importance"
  pacing: "Pacing was great as it really kept a steady pace throughout (with no need to add or cut on runtime)"
  climax: "Build to climax was incredible as the final hour of the movie was building to the fall of the Jedi; Climax was incredible as it was one of the best moments in Star Wars history (especially the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan fight)"
  tone: "Tone was very typical of the prequels and Star Wars (but the darker tones were a night touch as it brought a depressing aspect with glimpses of hope)"
  final_notes: "The movie was a real redemption for the prequels as we already expected the bad aspects of the movie yet we were still surprised the grandeur and level of story writing which makes this movie an iconic story in the Star Wars saga"
  overall: "Overall, An incredible story with the technical achievements that really make this movie a must watch and a favorite of mine as it helps bridge the prequels with the original trilogy, even though it does reek of the bad dialogue and direction that the rest of the prequels suffer from"
