title: "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"
rating: 5.4
review: "The entire movie is just JJ Abrams trying to correct the mistakes made by Rian Johnson, The first 2/3 of the movie as really bad and very cringe-worthy, the performances were very bland by all of the sequel trilogy characters, the screenplay was extremely repetitive and very boring, the story was just dumb and there are so many loose ends that will never be tied up, John Williams score so you know what it is, bad direction, Great Production Design, the pacing is fine because there is just zero expedition to tell anything that has happened before. The final third of the movie was pretty good, Very cringy movie overall."
