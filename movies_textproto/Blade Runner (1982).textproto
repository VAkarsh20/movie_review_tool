      comments: "A pretty lackluster performance from the lead as he really does not show any emotion throughout the entire movie (which takes away from his signature charm) and it just seems like he really does not want to be there, though there are some moments where he does do a good job"

      comments: "Plays a very bland and emotionless performance (which is fine for a replicant, but the point of her character is that she is not supposed to know that she is a replicant)"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was good for the most part and one of the better parts for the movie"
  pacing: "Pacing was very slow (which added to how the movie felt very boring)"
  climax: "Build to climax felt very boring as it was present but I really was not that captivated in what was going on; climax was present and a bit less boring (does have the most memorable monologue from the movie)"
  tone: "Tone was supposed to be very sci-fi and futuristic but ended up just being a very boring tone overall with its execution"
  final_notes: "Review for The Final Cut"
  overall: "Overall, a movie that has a huge following and big impact on the sci-fi genre as it begs many questions about humanity and what it means to be alive, but does not live up to such a high billing as it is poorly executed by its director and actors to the point that is is pretty hard to pay attention and watch due to how boring it is"
