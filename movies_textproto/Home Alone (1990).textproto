    comments: "The direction on a macro and microscale is pretty generic to 80s family comedies; the direction of actors is great as he can bring out the humor and joy in many moments, helps set the lighthearted tone that Kevin brings throughout the movie; storytelling is very similar to other John Hughes movies"

    comments: "The concept was unique and iconic for the time as it took the Christmas movie genre to new heights; the plot structure was very nicely laid out as there are no real wasted scenes in developing the story; flow between sequences is pretty standard to other John Hughes movies; character writing was great as you see the relationships Kevin has with the people around him (and how his mother cares about her son)"

    comments: "The house is very iconic and the traps laid out throughout it give the movie its iconic charm"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing was great as it was a steady pace that used its runtime very nicely"
  climax: "Build to the climax was great as it helped tie loose ends in Kevin\'s fears of being alone and with the old man; the climax is the most iconic part of the movie as it shows Kevin against the Wet Bandits as he lays the house out with traps to defend himself and show how he is not afraid anymore"
  tone: "Tone was very similar to other John Hughes movies (mixed with Christmas elements)"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, one of the best Christmas movies ever made as we get to see the iconic elements carried out by Culkin and the Wet Bandits as they navigate through the different traps and high jinks"
