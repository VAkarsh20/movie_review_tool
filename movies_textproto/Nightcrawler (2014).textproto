title: "Nightcrawler"
rating: 9.2
review: "Great to Incredible direction, Great to Incredible Screenplay (Writing for Jake was incredible (Both in character writing and how they made his character\'s dialogue be from the perspective of someone who reads info from online), but other aspects of the writing were not on the same level), Incredible Story, Brilliant Acting from Jake Gyllenhaal (Best performance to not get nominated for Best Actor), Very good acting by two other leads, good acting by supporting cast, Pacing was incredible towards the beginning and end but the middle hour of the movie was bit slow at times, Incredible character writing for Lou Bloom, Great to incredible Cinematography and lighting, Pretty good to good Score, Good build of suspense (a very high intensity film as well) to the climax but kinda tapers off with the final dialogue between Riz Ahmed and Jake (Would have liked to just see it end with the opening line). Overall, a movie that is incredible from the perspective of Lou as he drives the film forward but is only great from that perspective as he is the glue for all the pieces coming together."
