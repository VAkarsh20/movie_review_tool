title: "Midsommar"
rating: 8.4
review: "A great follow up to Hereditary for Ari Aster, Great Acting, Great Story, Great Screenplay, While it is not as layered nor does it have the depth of Hereditary it still does have a fair amount of layers and depth, Incredible Cinematography and visuals, Good pacing and the ending actually makes sense and is good (Unlike Hereditary), More grotesque than scary and there are scenes that are meant to be scary but are just funny instead, Good score, The perfect foil for Hereditary."
