title: "Parasite"
rating: 9.5
review: "Great Acting, Incredible Direction, Incredible Story, Incredible Screenplay (Both how Comedic it is and how trilling and powerful it is) even though it is in Korean and I was reading subtitles, Score was great in how it complements the movie, Incredible Symbolism in the commentary on Class Conflict, The Movie is broken into two separate parts (A comedic half and a thriller half), The pacing of the movie is very off because it spends too much time on the comedic side when a little bit more should be placed on the second half due to the commentary it is trying to convey, The issue with the pacing leads to the ending/epilogue to be very rushed, Overall Incredible Movie."
