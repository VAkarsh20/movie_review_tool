  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was good as all points were laid out at the perfect time in the movie; the resolution (while iconic) was a bit convoluted for no reason"
  pacing: "Pacing for the most part was good (although there were a lot of filler shots that could be cut into a quarter of the time just to fill space (like Norman cleaning or Marion\'s sister walking up the stairs))"
  climax: "The build to the climax was very well done with the actual climax being the most suspenseful and best part of the movie"
  final_notes: "the character of Norman Bates is incredibly written as it shows the effects isolation and jealously can have on an individual to descend into madness (with Perkins capturing this essence very well through his mannerisms and acting); the elements of horror as not necessarily the focal point of the movie as the film after the first hour is more a constant suspense rather than murders"
  overall: "Overall, a classic in the horror genre that lives up to the name as many iconic elements of the movie make Psycho a must watch for the slasher genre (especially considering how ahead of its time it was), even though it does have a good amount of filler elements"
