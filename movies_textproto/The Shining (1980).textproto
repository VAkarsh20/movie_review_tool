title: "The Shining"
rating: 8.7
review: "Good Direction (Great on a Macro scale of the entire shot but not so good on a micro scale when having dialogue between characters), Acting on a spectrum (Incredible by Jack, Decent to Good by supporting cast, Good and bad from the kid, and Very poor from the female lead), Incredible Story, Good Screenplay (Incredible use of Symbolism and Foreshadowing, good/iconic dialogue from Jack, medicore to decent for dialogue from other characters), Incredible Cinemotography, Very poor Film Editing (Transitions were bad, a lot of continuity issues, poor/very stiff editing for shot/reverse shot conversations (Which the movie relies on heavily)), Incredible Production Design, Great Pacing as the building of suspense to the climax was incredible, Great to Incredible use of score and sound Editing to convey the mood and establish suspense, a lot of pointless shots in the film that did not add value to the plot, Overall, Jack, the story, and the cinemotography carry the film on a macro scale to make it a relevant piece of Cinema history to study but the film fails to be Incredible due to the issues and problems on a micro scale."
