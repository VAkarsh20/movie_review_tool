    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is very safe and feel-good, and the look and feel for the movie feels overly put together; The direction on a microscale feels very safe and too PG-13, and it feels very forced in trying to display its messages; the storytelling is bad because the movie tries to tell two different stories at the same time that neither feel like they are told well; they do a bad job building tension as the tone of the movie makes it feel unserious"

    rating: "Bad to Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The concept is not good as they tell two stories at the same time that the movie becomes so unfocused, and they try to force this message about racial inequality in 1940s London that it really hurts the lessons they are trying to teach; the plot structure is pretty bad as they tell two parallel stories that really never converge, even though they are set up to flow; character writing is bad because these characters are pretty formulaic and filled with forced messages, and you never really care about them or what they go against"

  screenplay {
    writer {
      name: "Steve McQueen"
    }
    rating: "Bad to Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The dialogue is simple and forced, with messages they are trying to portray; the symbolism is so forced and overt that its simple representation of racial inequality actually hurts the message they are trying to portray, an example being there literally is a scene that could be straight out of Dhar Mann in the middle of the movie; the foreshadowing is not good because it\'s very obvious where this movie is going based on the tone and presentation of the movie"

    rating: "Decent to Pretty Good"
    comments: "It did a pretty good job showing London during the Blitz, but it looks a little fake and computer generated"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is not good, as the parallel story structure makes it feel slower than it actually is"
  climax: "Climax is safe; the build to the climax feels expected and formulaic"
  tone: "Tone is a big issue for this movie because the movie\'s safe, feel-good tone makes it feel overly produced and formulaic"
  final_notes: "I saw the premiere at the Austin Film Festival"
  overall: "Overall, a pretty bad, overly produced movie; Saoirse Ronan cannot save this movie\'s messy storytelling and shallow representation of racial inequality"
