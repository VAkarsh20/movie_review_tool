    cinematographer {

    }
    rating: "Brilliant"
    comments: "Especially with the angles and how they used light to emphasis the dark (blinding the face as well (which was a very nice touch in not showing the bad guys and painting them as elder figures the children should not trust)); also, the use of fog in the light helped create more of an ominous feeling"

    comments: "Groundbreaking for the time (especially the puppetry and use of flying), but did not age as well as other films from the time as the Green Screen is pretty obvious to see"
  }
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was laid out very nicely as each arc in the story did not feel like it was overstaying its place in the film (with all the elements building off of each other to help move the story forward)"
  pacing: "Pacing was consistent throughout the movie (with it not being too fast or too slow)"
  climax: "Build to climax was very evident and played out very well (with the characters planning on how they will let ET out); climax was executed very nicely and one of the most iconic moments in cinema history"
  tone: "Tone was more on the feel-good family movie side that has science fiction subject matter (and does a good job in helping develop this tone throughout the movie)"
  final_notes: "Design of ET was very iconic (even though it is very 80s) with the puppetry of the character being a very important part in creating how adorable and caring he was; the end of the movie really dragged out but was still incredibly emotional and iconic in how the movie closes the chapters on its characters"
  overall: "Overall, an iconic family movie that captures the hearts of its audiences through its titular character and the character\'s plight of trying to make his way back home, taking the audience on an emotional adventure that is guided with Spielberg\'s incredible direction, groundbreaking cinematography, and iconic John Williams Score"
