      comments: "Especially how he was able to embody someone with extreme anxiety and depression; Paul Giamatti is the focal point while all the others were great supporting elements to aspects of his character"

    comments: "A bit rough at first as the plot as the first 1/4, exposition of the movie was very dry in its details but the plot/story really begins to hit its stride and start running afterwards"

    comments: "The dialogue was both very conversational and elegant at times as it does a great job knowing when to shift from conversations to monologues throughout the movie (incorporating both the scholarly personality of Giamatti\'s character and the \'valley dude, player\' in Haden Church\'s character)"

  pacing: "Pacing was a bit on the slower side throughout the whole movie (with the first 1/4 being extremely slow and the final 3/4 being a bit slow); Runtime was decent but could have been a bit more optimal if 10-15 minutes was cut from the beginning of the movie"
  climax: "There really was no build to the climax but the ending was very well done as Giamatti\'s character really comes to terms with who is and what he wants"
  final_notes: "the portrayals of mental health concepts (anxiety, loneliness, depression) are very well done as Paul Giamatti does an excellent job in portraying someone who struggles with these concepts as he tries to try one final push at life"
  overall: "Overall, a great movie that starts off very rough (a true slow burn), but it is an excellent portrayal of finding one\'s self as they deal with personal struggles as we get a snapshot of a friendship exploring wine country looking for love, something that could have really been polished if the exposition was a bit tighter (making the movie possibly a 9.4-9.5)"
