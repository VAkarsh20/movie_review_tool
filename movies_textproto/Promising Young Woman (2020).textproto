  direction {
    director {
      name: "Emerald Fennell"
    }
    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The direction overall felt very amateurish as the acting was pretty still from the entire cast, the narrative progressed in a very forced way, and the macro and micro scenes were not that executed overall with somewhat deadpan editing style; the direction in the final 30 minutes was pretty good to good (with the major climactic scene shot very well) so there is promise and potential with Fennell"

      rating: "Good to Very Good"
      comments: "Takes control of all the scenes she is in and does a good job in some of the more desperation scenes (somewhat being menacing when she needs to be); the fake/drunk scenes feel more ironic than actually good acting because to the common eye its obvious she is faking"

      comments: "Plays mostly from experience rather than taking direction, but she does a good job in holding her own and showing some desperation when needed"

      comments: "Isn\'t given that much screen-time but does a pretty good job at the moment you find out how much of a terrible person he is (despite trying to look and sound reformed)"

      comments: "Her performance just feels like it has no emotion and she has no chemistry with Mulligan at all"

      rating: "Decent to Pretty Good"
      comments: "Plays more from experience than direction here, and even with that he is only so good with how desperate his character is (which feels like it was not given that much to work with)"

    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The story is very interesting as we get to see Mulligan\'s character dive deeper and deeper into what caused her trauma; the chapters weren\'t used that well to help break up the movie and could\'ve probably been omitted; the final 30 minutes of the movie was well written and helps create suspense through the climax and close things off in the resolution"

  screenplay {
    writer {
      name: "Emerald Fennell"
    }
    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The dialogue feels more like a parody than being profound (especially in the more touchy subject scenes) and just feels very amateurish overall; the comedic elements were decently funny (mainly the Bo Burnham parts); the symbolism was more overt and just felt very forced; the foreshadowing was pretty good (especially in the end)"

    comments: "The sharp use of shot-reverse shot just felt very amateurish and broke up from the flow of narrative; the other shots overall just reeked of amateurism"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was kinda formulaic as it was obvious what position in the story the movie was in and the use of chapters did not help with breaking up the movie"
  pacing: "Pacing was a lot slower than it should be given the movie should be a thriller"
  climax: "Climax was the best part of the movie and was executed very well in giving truth to Mulligan\'s struggle and showing who the real monsters of the movie are (giving hope for Fennell in the future as a filmmaker)"
  tone: "Tone was very similar to other female-led thrillers (though the comedic elements did make the movie a bit more unique)"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, a movie that is held back from amateurism as Carey Mulligan\'s performance can only go so far given the bland writing and pretty bad direction from the first time director, though Fennell does give promise as a filmmaker as the climax and resolution are executed well."
