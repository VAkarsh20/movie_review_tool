title: "Batman Begins"
rating: 8.7
review: "Good Direction (Great at times when directing the story and actions but poor when directing dialogue between minor characters and extras), Good Acting by all cast members that came back in the series and Falcone (Includes Liam and Murphy as they have cameos in the future movies), Poor acting by supporting cast and Katie Holmes, Katie and Bale have little to no chemistry, Great Cinemotography, Incredible Story (Especially for an Origin story), Good Screenplay (Incredible at incorporating story elements as symbols and foreshadowing but dialogue is on a spectrum from poor to Incredible), Incredible Score, Great Pacing, Some plotholes from towards the end, Basically this movie was a test run for The Dark Knight as it used the feedback on what to improve on and did that incredibly (Making bad elements incredible and good elements Brilliant)."
