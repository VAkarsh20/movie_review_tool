    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is a well-executed, over-the-top action movie, like you see in other Tollywood movies; The direction on a microscale is decent; The storytelling is decent; He builds tension in a way very on par with other Telugu movies"

    comments: "The concept is a standard sequel; The plot structure is pretty simple for the most part, but the final 40 minutes of the movie are completely useless as they start a new storyline; The character writing is good for Pushpa as they continue to build this memorable character for this character-driven franchise"

    comments: "The dialogue is decent; the humor is pretty good; the symbolism is somewhat present because the major themes of this movie deal with family and acceptance; the foreshadowing makes the movie pretty predictable"

  pacing: "Pacing is very slow as it feels like they are dragging the story out;"
  climax: "Climax is unnecessary, as they added a brand new storyline that added nothing to the original storyline; this could have been cut, and the movie could have been a lot tighter"
  tone: "Tone is very action-Tollywood"
  final_notes: ""
  overall: "Overall, a Tollywood sequel with traditional South Indian action sequences and a memorable character performance from Allu Arjun, but the bloated story makes this movie run for a lot longer than it needs to"
