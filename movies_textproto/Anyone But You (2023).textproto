    rating: "Bad"
    comments: "The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that\'s what they think the audience \'wants\' as they try too hard to be \'modern,\' meaning the director couldn\'t make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com"

      comments: "The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it\'s just the material is so bad he can only do so much)"

    comments: "The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare\'s \'Much Ado About Nothing,\' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)"

    comments: "The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable"

  plot_structure: "Plot Structure followed the source material\'s and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable)"
  pacing: "Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace)"
  climax: "Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie)"
  tone: "Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s)"
  final_notes: "It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable"
  overall: "Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny"
