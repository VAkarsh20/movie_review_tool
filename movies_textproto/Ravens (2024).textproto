    director {
      name: "Mark Gill"
    }
    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is artistic and polished; the direction on a microscale is pretty good for the most part as the scenes between characters are really engaging, the scenes with the Raven are poorly executed and tacky; the storytelling is clear and unique, besides the raven moments"

    writer {

    rating: "Good to Very Good"
    comments: "The concept is good as it goes through the life of tortured photographer Masahisa Fukase; the plot structure is very good as it does a good job jumping between the past and the present to tell Fukase\'s story; character writing is good as they do a good job painting Masahisa Fukase as this troubled artist and how those around him are effected by it but the writing for the Raven is pretty bad"

  screenplay {
    writer {
      name: "Mark Gill"
    }
    rating: "Good"
    comments: "The dialogue is polished and profound, but the English dialogue for the Raven was not good and unnecessary; the humor is present and helps lighten the tone; the symbolism is very profound as the Raven symbolizes the darkness for the protagonist, but these aspects for the movie were not that well executed; the foreshadowing is profound as the plot structure for the movie really heightens the importance of foreshadowing to tell the story"

  pacing: "Pacing is fine, as the slower pace helps you sit with and get to know these characters"
  climax: "The climax is executed well"
  tone: "Tone feels like an artsy biopic"
  final_notes: "I saw the world premiere at the Austin Film Festival"
  overall: "Overall, a pretty good biopic on Japanese photographer Masahisa Fukase, as the film is a polished execution depicting the tortured artist; but the scenes with ravens are pretty unnecessary and draw away from the storytelling"
