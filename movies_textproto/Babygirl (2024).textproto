    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is pretty good as they created an aestheic that really suited the movie; the direction on a microscale is pretty good as they use tension and cringe to really heighten the scandal and power-dynamic between the two; the storytelling is pretty simple; they tension very well as the movie uses this to make the moments between the two leads uncomfortable; the movie is very-much told from the female perspective, and the director does a good job showing this"

    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "The concept is interesting, but the story itself is pretty bland and predictable; the plot structure is very simple; character writing is good as you get a sense of how the personal struggles and power-dynamic of Romy is influencing her decisions, and the Samuel's mystery kinda helps make this an intriguing relationship for Romy"

  screenplay {
    writer {
      name: "Halina Reijn"
    }
    rating: "Decent to Pretty Good"
    comments: "The dialogue is sound, but feels a little too Gen Z; the humor is decent; the symbolism is profound as the movie tackles issues with power-dynamics, women in power, and sexual fantasies; the foreshadowing is not good as events towards the end just happen just because that is what you expect"

      name: "Jasper Wolf"
    }
    rating: "Good"
    comments: "Really enjoyed the cinemaography as it gave it an aesthic that really fit the hustling nature of the New York business world; really enjoyed how they used the glass reflection as somewhat of a mirror"

      name: "Matthew Hannam"
    }
    rating: "Good"
    comments: "Movie felt well edited, especially towards the end"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is a little all over the place because it seems slow in a lot of moments, yet they just speed run through plot points in other moments; the passage of time is not really clear so you have no idea what the time period is"
  climax: "Climax is alright but not really the best in execution"
  tone: "Tone is very much an erotic thriller"
  final_notes: "I liked the aesthic of the movie more than the actual story"
  overall: "Overall, a pretty good movie that is carried by its aesthic and Nicole Kidman's performance, but is held back by its lackluster writing"
