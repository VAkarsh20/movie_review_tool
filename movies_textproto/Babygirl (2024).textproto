    rating: "Pretty Good"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is pretty good as they created an aesthetic that really suited the movie; The direction on a microscale is pretty good as they used tension and cringe to really heighten the scandal and power dynamic between the two; The storytelling is pretty simple; They use tension very well as the movie uses this to make the moments between the two leads uncomfortable; The movie is very much told from the female perspective and the director does a good job showing this"

      comments: "A very vulnerable performance as she shows why she is one of the best in Hollywood;  She shows a wide range of emotions; She has pretty good chemistry with Dickinson"

    rating: "Decent"
    comments: "The concept is interesting, but the story itself is pretty bland and predictable; The plot structure is very simple; Character writing is good, as you get a sense of how Romy\'s personal struggles and power dynamic are influencing her decisions, and Samuel\'s mystery helps make this an intriguing relationship for Romy"

  screenplay {
    writer {
      name: "Halina Reijn"
    }
    rating: "Decent to Pretty Good"
    comments: "The dialogue is sound but feels a little too Gen Z; the humor is decent; the symbolism is profound as the movie tackles issues with power dynamics, women in power, and sexual fantasies; the foreshadowing is not good as events toward the end just happen because that is what you expect"

      name: "Jasper Wolf"
    }
    rating: "Good"
    comments: "Really enjoyed the cinematography as it gave it an aesthetic that really fit the hustling nature of the New York business world; Really enjoyed how they used the glass reflection as somewhat of a mirror"

      name: "Matthew Hannam"
    }
    rating: "Good"
    comments: "The movie felt well-edited, especially toward the end"
  }
  pacing: "Pacing is a little all over the place because it seems slow in many moments, yet they just speed through plot points in other moments; The passage of time is not really clear, so you have no idea what the time period is"
  climax: "Climax is all right but not really the best in execution;"
  tone: "Tone is very much an erotic thriller;"
  final_notes: "I liked the aesthetic of the movie more than the actual story;"
  overall: "Overall, a pretty good movie that is carried by its aesthetic and Nicole Kidman\'s performance, but it is held back by its lackluster writing"
