    comments: "Very noticeable in the music performances"
  }
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was laid out pretty nicely but the final 40 minutes of the movie feels like it starts to fall apart with the lack of effort put in by a lot of moving pieces (it is as if the movie should have ended at the 90 minute mark because the climax and resolution feel very forced)"
  pacing: "Pacing was good for the most part (it is just that the end really does not come together very nicely because it almost alludes to doing something new but just ends up being safe in the end)"
  climax: "Build to climax was not really there; climax was very mediocre cause it is common cliche and does not really add anything but comedic moments"
  tone: "Tone of the movie was handled very nicely because you are almost immersed in the early 70s culture through the language and music/really gets that feel-good feel similar to movies like Dazed and Confused"
  final_notes: "The movie is very feel-good and plays to a lot of the style that early 2000s movies had (which is fine) but it just feels like it tries to be very safe as it is going in one direction by falls apart as is corrects itself in being more safe"
  overall: "Overall, a well written movie that was a fun watch with some good performances but plays a little too safe and kinda falls apart towards the end"
