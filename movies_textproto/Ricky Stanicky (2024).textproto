    rating: "Pretty Bad"
    comments: "The direction on a macroscale is like every stereotypical comedy from the 2010s; the direction on a microscale is decent as the performances feel elevated, there is a good amount of comedy, and the interpersonal scenes help show the relationships within the cast; the storytelling feels like it runs out of breath towards the end because it feels like they just give up on trying to tell a coherent story towards the climax"

    comments: "The concept is incredibly fun and interesting (I love the idea of Ricky Stanicky); the plot structure is kinda a mess as the movie just feels like the first half is exposition and the climax feels incredibly forced and deflated; character writing is pretty good as you get a sense of who this friend group is and who \'Ricky Stanicky\' is"

    comments: "The dialogue is pretty bland and formulaic; the humor is pretty good for the most part, but feels very forced in the climax; the symbolism is somewhat prevalent for this type of movie; the foreshadowing is incredibly forced and makes this movie feel very formulaic/feel-good"

  pacing: "Pacing is a bit of a mess because the first half feels incredibly slow and the climax is incredibly fast; the movie could have cut 30 minutes of the exposition and it would\'ve been the same movie"
  climax: "Climax is poorly executed as it is incredibly fast and feels very forced (and none of the jokes in this part hit either)"
  tone: "Tone is very 2010s comedy"
  final_notes: "Ricky Stanicky is such a good title for this movie"
  overall: "Overall, a pretty mindless comedy that has memorable performances from Zac Efron and John Cena as well as good humor for the most part, but has a poorly managed plot and a deflated climax"
