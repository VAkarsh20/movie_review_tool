    rating: "Great"
    comments: "Does a Great job at moving the story forward through the use of symbols and ideas that are very mature to a children\'s movie; really helps blend the fun nature of Puss in Boots with the serious nature of the plot and also fits in the fighting scenes very well to keep the audience engaged with what is going on"

    comments: "The actual story is very simple in that there a journey from point A to point B, but the sub-elements and the journey towards the end are very complex as the characters really find out what they want from life; the actual concept of the journey also stems from the fairy-tale aspect that made Shrek very famous; the use of it being Puss\' last life was also a good touch"

    comments: "The dialogue is very clever and is written very well to have innuendos for both a younger and more mature audience; the symbolism and foreshadowing was great for a children\'s movie and really is a lot deeper than many children\'s movies have gone before"

    rating: "Incredible"
    comments: "Really takes from the Spider-verse style and runs with it as it feels very cartoony with some shades of Anime (Something that is a breath of fresh air to the animated movie space); the fight scenes were were well animated and really enjoyable to watch"
  }
  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was laid out very well as all the elements flowed well into each other and the conclusion was met after everything was resolved"
  pacing: "Pacing was very good as it did not really feel like any time was needed to be cut or added"
  climax: "Climax was great as the fighting mixed with the animation made the scenes very captivating"
  tone: "Tone had elements that were similar to a children\'s movie but also had elements that were from the hero\'s journey (with some mixes of depressing tones to show puss\' anxiety)"
  final_notes: "A great representation of how anxiety and ego take effect on an individual as it masks Puss\' fear of death very well with the backdrop of it being a children\'s movie (something not only few animated films have done but any film really)"
  overall: "Overall, a movie that at the surface plays very well for children as it follows the iconic Puss in Boots on his adventure, but overall has a much stronger and deeper meaning of living life without fear and anxiety as the creators synergized incredible animation with great writing to make this movie a must watch"
