  plot_structure: "Plot Structure was good for the most part (but the beginning was a bit hard to understand (but can get past this after the first 20-30 mins))"
  pacing: "Pacing was generally good but there are some slower parts meant for character development (not a huge problem); The movie was a bit on the longer side but there really isn\'t that many scenes that could be cut (so it gets a pass)"
  climax: "Build to the climax is incredible with the ending being extremely suspenseful and unpredictable"
  overall: "Overall, a movie that is a must watch, even with its small faults, as it uses Boston wit and humor laced into a story and screenplay to show the effects trauma and crime can have on people stuck in the rat race as the push through through what is ethical, in what is a Martin Scorsese masterpiece"
