Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,8.1,"REDUX: (09/04/22) Good to Very Good Direction (Able to move the story forward (though in a more cautious manner) and execute the action scenes very well; also does a pretty good job in getting the most of out his actors (though they are limited throughout the movie)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good Felicity Jones (Able to command all the scenes she is in and be a very vocal leader with her cast and during the action scenes, though she does some limitations when it comes to the more powerful scenes), Good from Diego Luna (Able to hold his own for a majority of the movie and does well in the more action-packed scenes, but he shows his ceiling in many of the dramatic scenes), Very Good from Ben Mendelsohn (able to play the villian role very well and shows range throughout the movie in being that menacing figure wanting more power), Great from Alan Tudyk (Really steals the show with his performance as he plays the smartwitted/comedic relief character), Pretty Good to Good from Riz Ahmed (Plays the anxious character well but does show a bit of inexperience to where his character is not that believable), Decent from Forest Whitaker (Very over-the-top in his performance but does a good job in commanding the scenes he is in), Decent from James Earl Jones (Something just feels very off from his performance (probably from the age), but he does do a good job in making Vader feel like a menacing presense), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (just typical Star Wars level acting)), Very Good to Great Story (The architecture of the story is very well laid out and entertaining (even though there are massive deviations from the traditional storytelling), though the storytelling is a bit on the safer side and not as  ambitious as other Star Wars movies; the story also does try to jam a lot into it and this takes away from building some of the side characters and their relationships to the story), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (While there were some iconic lines, a lot of this movie is filled with corny dialogue meant to build power (but just ends up being a bit more laughable; The character writing for some of the characters were really good but they introduce so many characters that it just waters down all the new introductions; the foreshadowing, symbolism, and allusions to A New Hope were very well executed as it helps paint a more hollistic picture of the first Star Wars movie (especially painting the rebellion to be a bit more on the darker side)), Very Good to Great Score (Helps keep that Star Wars feel while adding new themes to the universe), Great Cinematography, Incredible Sound, Incredible Editing, Great to Incredible Visual Effects (Everything from this movie was incredible but the Deepfakes did show their age as it falls more into the uncanny valley now), Very Good Production Design, Very Good Makeup, Great Costumes (Helps pay homage to A New Hope's costumes), Plot Structure was very well executed from a macro level as it helps entertain the audience but there is a lot jammed into the movie that it takes away from helping build the characters and their importance (they are kinda just plopped into the story), Pacing was a bit on the faster side cause of how much they try to jam (if they cut like cut 30 minutes of new content/characters and used it to slow the pace and build up some of their characters the movie would have a bit better execution), the build to climax was very well done and is a bit similiar to other blockbuster/Star Wars movies, climax was incredibly executed and the best part of the movie (whether it be from the fights on the ground to the fire fights), tone of the movie is very similiar to other Star Wars movies but the movie does have a bit of a unique feel that is seperate, the movie does a great job in displaying fan service as it does a good job in showing the importance and elements of the original film (whether it be the allusions or the ending scene that is jaw-dropping in its execution). Overall, an entertaining movie that helps rejuvenate the Star Wars franchise through its well executed action scenes and fan-service to the original film, though it is filled with corny dialogue and introduction of too many new elements that it not able to be on the same par as the original trilogy.. ORIGINAL: 8.5. Final Third of the movie was amazing, great action, great plot, has a gradual progression from slow to fast pace, not a memorable cast due to the fact that they all die.

Jackson (In their very brief roles), Pretty Good to Good from everyone else)), Great Story (At its core the movie is pretty surface level in that cops are trying to make a break for themselves, but the typical Adam McKay and Will Ferrell story elements really make different elements of the story funny), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (One of the funniest movies I have watched due to the quotable jokes and how stereotypical of a Will Ferrell movie this is), Good Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Good Visuals. Plot Structure was very nice and laid out well, Pacing was good as it kept a consisent pace (with no scenes really needed to be cut, but some of the deleted scenes were very funny), the build to climax was very typical of movies from this time (so pretty good), climax was good (A generic mix of 2000s action with comedic elements), tone was set very nicely as it followed the action comedy template very nicely. Overall, an incredibly funny movie that is incredibly quotable and a must watch for the jokes and the chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlburg as it is a pillar in the buddy cop genre that began to take over the early 2010s.

Requiem for a Dream ,9.3,"REDUX: (01/11/22) Great to Incredible Direction (Aronofsky is able to get memorable performances out of his actors as they are elevated through is script, use of symbolism, and unique editing and cinematography), Great Acting Overall from the main cast (Brilliant by Ellen Burstyn (delivers a career rebirth through this performance as she is able to completely transform herself into a fractured mother still looking to keep hold of his family that is fading away from her), Very Good from Jared Leto (shows promise throughout the movie was is able to handle the emotional moments very well (though does faulter at times for a bit of a newer actor), Very Good to Great from Jennifer Connelly (a performance that really helped shift her career in a different direction as she emodies an individual who is slowly being numb as she succumbs to her addictions), Good to Very Good from Marlon Waynes (a suprisingly good peformance from the known comedic actor as he steps out of his comfort zone to play his character very well), pretty bad to decent from the minor characters). Incredible Story (very well structured as we get to see how the characters slowly decline and succumb to their addictions), Great to Incredible Screenplay (Filled with great symbolism and imagery as well as great dialogue for the most part, there are some very questionable moments however), Incredible to Brilliant Score (really helped set the tone of the movie and is very iconic in its own-right), Incredible Cinematography for the most part (as we get to see the camera help give perspective to the characters, though it can be very nausiating at times), Incredible Editing for the most part (the jump cuts and the scenes where the characters are getting high are very well conducted and helped create an artsy genre for the public to see, though some of the editing choices were questionable), Good to Great sound (helped show the routine the characters went through as using the drugs just became a habit for them, though some of the sound choices were a bit cartoony and out of place), the plot structure was great as the movie is just a constant build to the climax with no resolution (something that was an intended message for the characters), pacing was extremely fast (and while this was an intention, it was still kinda made it a bit hard to follow), the build to the climax was incredible as the whole movie just builds to it, the climax itself is one of the most memorable parts of the movie as it shows how far all the characters went with their addictions and how there was no turning back anymore (something that was helped strengthened through there being no resolution), the movie is filled was incredible moments and does an incredible job with the low budget it is given but it is still filled with many flaws that showed why a movie like this was very unsuccessful went it came out (that and how grotesque it was). Overall, a must watch as Aronofsky puts himself on the mainstream map by crafting an incredible insight into the descent people go to fill the void of happiness they have as we get to see 4 characters spiral out of control through their addictions, though it is not a perfect movie as it is filled with many flaws (and not being it is nausiating and grotesque). ORIGINAL: 8.3. Very good but soooooooo fucked up. Acting was great, Screenplay was excellent, Story was excellent, Incredible Score, waaay to grotesque, jump cuts created a genre.",10/20/2017 (WITH REDUX),50,tt0180093,4.5

Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,8.0,"Contiunation of a beloved classic and one of, if not the, greatest comedies of all time. In its sequel, Borat does not have as much of the charm as its original movie did. Very funny at times but very mild or bland or disgusting at others, story was coherent as very poltiically brown nose against the right, the movie is ultamitely propoganda to vote. Sasha was great, though lost a step from her previous version, Tutar was good acting but was no where near the level of sidekick as Azamt, Good but safe story, Very good but safe screenplay, Good direction (But misleading editing). Overall, This movie was a good look back into one of the greatest movies of all time but plays it safe and ultamitley boils down into a movie urging the audience to vote out the right (making it a very topical movie at the present but something that will not make it a classic like its predecssor). This movie really didn't have to be made and turns down into a cash grab on a retired character. ",10/29/2020,166,tt13143964,3.5

Fargo (1996 film),8.6,"Very Good Direction, Great Screenplay  that is laced with witty, quirky midwestern dialogue (Could really been seen by the intentional awkward pauses during the Minnesotan convesations), Great Story but is very surface level in its imagery and symbolism, Acting was on the spectrum (Great by Frances, Very Good by Macy, Very Good to Good by Steve, Good by the remaining main cast, decent by the supporting cast and extras), Incredible to Great Cinematography (Especially the distant panning shots that show the constrast between the main images and the snow), For a short runtime the pacing is Great but is incredibly rushed towards the end (particularly the final 15-20 minutes). Overall, the Coen brothers give their prime example of why they are some of the best screenwriters in hollywood as they make a short runtime filled with many memorable, funny moments (even though it may not be as incredible as other movies), only faltering towards the end as it is incredibly rushed that feels like it could've used 15 more minutes to keep up to the pace it had for the majority of the movie.",11/22/2020,168,tt0116282,4.0

Overall, a movie that is very hard to watch in the first 1/3 (both becasue of imagery, understanding the dialogue, plot, and pace) but once you get past that point it is an great to incredible piece of art that shows the line between psychological treatment and free will as well as the ability for the redemption of the lost.",11/27/2020,169,tt0066921,4.5

Overall, a fun movie to watch for leisure that has many jokes that hit very well and are very quotable, even though it may be stupid funny. ",12/26/2020,173,tt0415306,3.5

Overall, An iconic christmas movie that is filled with many emotions, makes you root for the characters, and makes you remember the spirit of christmas, even though it is very safe, formulaic, cliche, and plays its cards very close to its chest (Something I can't really blame given its a family christmas movie).",12/26/2020,174,tt0319343,4.0

Overall, a movie that is kinda overrated, has not aged that well compared to other christmas movies, and has incredible pacing and length issues, but is still an entertaining watch for the family during christmas time.",12/26/2020,175,tt0085334,3.0

Overall, The best Pixar movie (a little biased :)) that shows the loving dynamic of a father-daughter relationship through an animation filled adventure.

Overall, a movie that is a must watch, even with its small faults, that using boston wit and humor laced with a story and screenplay that shows the effects trauma and crime can have on people as they make decisions that benefit their rat race the most, even if they are not the most ethical, in what is a Martin Scorsese's masterpiece.

First Blood,8.5,"Good Direction, Acting pretty good overall (Sly was great (though I'm biased), colonel was pretty good, and the rest were decent), Very Good Story that actually handles PTSD from Vietnam pretty well, Minimal Screenplay that works to show how tramuatized Rambo is, Sound Editing/Mixing was a bit off (But thats the 80s for yah), Action is what keeps the movie going as the pacing is very fast (with a short runtime) as Rambo builds up his arsenal with more kills he gets, Very short runtime that would have defintely benefited from 15-20 minutes of character building or exposition, Build to the climax was pretty good with the overall climax executed very well where we see all the sides of Rambo, it is imporant to note that many of the actions that Rambo did were extremely unnecessary and escalted the situation a lot more than it needed to be. Overall, A movie that is a fun action movie to watch as Sly gives off one of his iconic performances to create a signature character that is the a war machine suffereing from PTSD that is trying his best just to live in a post-Vienam, anti-war society.

Reservoir Dogs,8.6,"Good Direction, Good Acting overall by the cast (Steve Buschemi and Harvey K stood out the most), Good Story, Great Screenplay that is very Quinten-esqe, editing was Tarentino esqe, pacing was all over the place given the way the narrative was told (No fault really), very short runtime which is fine because there is very little plot, the actual plot of the movie is very minimal given that you are thrown right at the end and you have to put pieces toghether through, there really isn't any build to anything (No fault given that you start at the very end), A lot of mistakes and misses which shows in Tarentino's first film (Definitely can see his growth throughout his career), the feel and style of the movie has a very similar feel to Usual Suspects (But I liked this one more). Overall, a ""Usual Suspects"" type film that is a good watch with good moments that shows a sloppy, amateur filmmaker that is looking to make a name for himself, and it is a great launching point for one of the best filmmakers ever.

Overall, A movie that is extremely metaphoical in nature about he world moving towards an evil that the old cannot adapt to that is filled with Iconic Dialogue, Great Action moments, and Incredible performances that make the movie a must watch that is incredibly true to the source material, even the though the pace is very slow and the tone is very dull.",01/19/2021,181,tt0477348,4.5

Overall, A decent movie that shows moments of greatness from a future star (Bale and somewhat Leto) that has good moments to watch (the killing scenes) with a story with a twist at the end, but there are a lot of flaws in the movie that make it very hard to watch at times when looking at the greed of wall street from a very surface level, literal, and pretencious lense.

Overall, For a movie with such a low budget, the creaters were able to develop the most from what they could and created an iconic story line that is a mainstay in the horror franchise, even though it may not be the best in its presentation.",05/11/2021,187,tt0387564,2.5

In terms of plot, the first 30 minutes of the movie were extremely boring and pointless to the story in that cutting it and spreading it more to the alluding of the possession and actual excorsim could make the movie alot better,  Movie filled with many plot holes/leadups that are never addressed, In terms of the climax, extremely intense and very scary that really shows the devils work in the poession (Something that was very ahead of its time), Overall, even though the movie does falter a lot in the development of its plot and pacing, The Exorcist was a grounbreaking movie in the horror genre that was very well made (With its direction, screenplay, and acting) and stands up to be one of the most iconic movies not only in its genre but all time.

Lost in Translation (film),6.3,"Decent Direction (Its best moments were during conversations between Scarjo and Murray, Very good acting from Murray and Good to Very good acting from Scarjo (There really wasn't a supporting cast for the movie), The story was a decent concept but really nothing happens in this movie, the screenplay was meant to be awkward and being ""lost in translation"" and it did capture that well but I also felt that it made the movie very boring and dull because of it, The cinematography was good for the equipement and budget they had (But could be a bit off at times), The pacing of the movie was constant and slow so nothing to complain, The entire movie was basically just panning shots mixed with close ups of the actors faces plus improve dialogue in conversations, The symbolism and capturing the loneliness of being in a foreign country and finding love when you already have it was not as well captured as people say it is for this movie because I definitely feel that it was not displayed well enough (even if it was subtle), Overall, a movie that is pretty overatted this is filled with shots of Japan, that is mixed with good dialgoue and scenes between Bill Murray and Scarjo, but in the end falters from its lack of story and very dull presentation (as it fails to capture to true aspects of loneliness).",05/24/2021,189,tt0335266,2.5
Catch Me If You Can,9.2,"Great Direction, Great to Incredible Acting by Leo, Hanks, and Walkin (Rest of the cast was Good), Great Screeplay that is filled with foreshadowing, Incredible Story that stays pretty true to the source material, Good Score, Pacing of the movie was great up until the final like 20 minutes (probably could have cut it down to 10), The build to the climax was incredible as the standoff scene between Leo and Hanks really showed both actor's best in displaying the anxiety and fright of the situation. Overall, a great film that is one of the most entertaining films to watch as it is a thrill of a ride to see all the different scams Frank Abagnale was able to pull off from the very start to the very end, something that really keeps you engaged it all times.

Tropic Thunder,9.1,"Great Direction, Great to Good acting by the entire cast as a whole (with RDJ being incredible), Extremely funny story that is effective satire to a core, Screenplay filled with jokes that are reeks of 00s esqe comedy but still very funny and quoteable, pacing was good, build to the climax was very good, plot was simple with very cheesy plot cliches yet still effective at mocking hollywood and oscars. Overall, a movie that is iconic for its edgy humor and star studded cast that was able to mock and make fun of the oscars so much that they could build an oscar campaign for RDJ and actually get him a nomination (something legendary in itself).",05/26/2021,191,tt0942385,4.5
Brokeback Mountain,9.5,"Incredible to Brilliant Direction (Both on a macro scale with the subjects in vast shots and a micro scale with interpersonal dialogue), Incredible acting by Two leads (Very Good to Great by the rest of the cast), Incredible story (though a bit confusing on passage of time), Incredible and Beautiful Screenplay, Incredible Cinematography that was able to capture the beauty of both the landscapes and how the leads were able to escape and find love there, There isn't that much of a climax (More of a build to a shock and reaction?) but the overall plot was consistent, pacing was fine but it was very confusing on what scenes look play in what year cause it jumps alot (even showing it subtly would have helped), Great Score that molded well to the emotions of the characters and the beauty of the scenes, Runtime was fine but there were definitely scenes that could have been cut to make it a bit shorter. Overall, a very beautiful movie (both in scenary and acting/dialogue) that is one of the best depictions of falling in love I have ever seen as the two lead male characters have to escape to a beautiful seclution to show their true love for each other, something society won't let them do.",05/27/2021,192,tt0388795,5.0
Mystic River (film),9.4,"Great to Incredible Direction, Incredible Acting from Sean Penn with Great to Incredible Acting from Tim Robbins with Very Good to Great acting from the rest of the cast, Great Screenplay (With incredible moments and questionable moments), Incredible Story (especially how it analyzes the effects of trauma on an individual), Decent Score, Good Editing, Pacing was on the slower side but pretty overall, runtime was decent (but there were definitely scenes that could be cut as they were unnecessary, bout like 10-15 minutes worth), Plot development was very good as there are two parallel stories to try and look for the killer (Though the development of Kevin Bacon's character was a bit confusing on how it was presented), the build the climax was great with the climax being incredible as well as the falling action and finding out the true story of the killing, the resolution was kinda poor and not carried out well, one of the best protrayals of trauma and grief I have ever seen carried out. Overall, a Great to Incredible movie that is one of the best presentations on the effects loss and trauma can have on people as the leads try to come to terms with what they have experienced, all symbolized in an very well carried out murder mystery.",05/28/2021,193,tt0327056,4.5

Overall, a film that is very visually pleasing (an artsy movie that actually pulls it off very nicely) and well made that makes society question AI and how cognizant we should make Automata (definitely one of the better protrays of this phenomenon), even if the film blows it more out of proporation/exaggerates the extent/ideas behind it.

The Sixth Sense,8.3,"Good Direction (especially in the horror parts), Pretty Good to Good acting overall (Haley Joel Osmat was Very Good), Good Story, Good Screenplay (Some great aspects/iconic lines and some mediocre to decent ones), Decent Score (Very James Newton Howard-esqe), Pacing was fine (could be a bit slow at times and very rushed at others), plot development was ok but really doesn't go anywhere, the film really does not have any climax (will get to the ""twist"" in a bit), as nothing really happens (don't want to spoil anything but there really isn't any resolution), the horror parts of the movie were very well executed and definitely showed some of M.Night's best work as the audience definitely is on the edge of their seat, the famous ""twist"" at the end while iconic is filled with plot holes and is can be easily picked up when watching the movie (like I did know it but still could have picked it up if I didn't). Overall, a pretty good movie (espeically for horror) that has alot of bright moments (like haley joel osmat) that put me on the edge of my seat and make the movie a horror classic and put M.Night on the map, even though it falters a lot in terms of the plot holes and lackluster moments.",05/30/2021,196,tt0167404,3.5
In Bruges,8.9,"Very Good to Great Direction (Especially how he molds the classical elements with the humor and serious moments), Great acting by lead two (Colin a bit better) with Very Good by Ralph and good by the rest of the cast, Very funny, poltically incorrect screenplay that is great with the serious aspects as well (can be a bit repetitive but thats just the nature of the dialogue), Good to Very Good story, Great score in how it molds well to display the classical scenery of Bruges, Pacing is good with runtime used effectively, Sound Mixing/Editing was not good because it was very overbearing at times in the movie (making it hard to pay attention to what was going on at times), the build to the climax was good and the ending was open-ended in a way that was done very well, Handles elements of grief over past actions pretty well for a comedy (though not really the best) and handles elements of purpose on heaven/hell pretty well for a comedy. Overall, a suprisingly very good to great comedy that mixes serious elements of purpose and grief very well with politically incorrect, hilarious dialogue as it goes through the lives of the two leads trying to come to terms with the actions of their past.

Overall, and incredibly, beautiful story on the effects prison has on men (even inncocent men) as they have to come to terms with their lives as they are stripped away from their freedom and have to continue to find hope even though the system keeps on trying to strip it away from them (something that makes you care for the subjects and makes you cheer and cry for them). Moreover, the film is 1/3 of the trio of 1994 that is the embodiment of cinema before that year (given by the story telling and feel of the movie being from the 50s-60s).",06/05/2021,198,tt0111161,5.0

Overall, and Incredible Movie that stands up to being ""One of the best movies ever made"" as it is the defintiion of subtly and symbolism (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions) in a movie as Coppala delievers a magnum opus not only in his career but for the whole film industry (something that others have tried to learn from).",06/10/2021,199,tt0068646,5.0

Overall, a Great to Incredible Movie that stands up to being ""One of the best sequels ever made"" as it is the defintiion of symbolism and visual queues (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions, especially Michael's eyes looking to characters) in a movie as Coppala offers a continuation of a story rather than a sequel.",06/11/2021,200,tt0071562,4.5
The Godfather Part III,5.0,"Pretty Bad Direction, Bad Acting overall (Good perfomances from Diane Keaton and Al Pacino (Though Pacino was either Great and typical Michael or Bad and overacting/disappointing), Mediocre to Decent performances from Taila Shire and Andy Garcia, Bad performances by the rest of the cast (can clearly see how losing character from the previous movies effected this one), and one of the worst (if not the worst) performances in Sofia Coppala), Pretty Bad story overall (The story of Michael's decline needed to be made and there were some good elements but the way they went about it really ruined his story arc; storytelling being a bit confusing), Very Bad Screenplay (Extremely simple and Direct unlike its predecessors even though there are some elements of symbolism), The use of new technology and techiques in sound/cinematography really gave the feeling an off feel as it looks completely different than its predecessors (making it very weird they they cut back to footage from the previous movies but still keep its original quality, Terrible Film Editing as they cut for this movie was extremely off and really jumped around too much in the story where many details were lost (even though there were style choices similiar to the past movies), Great Score, Pacing was Slow and steady, Runtime was long but the cut they chose for the movie made it really hard to believe that more scenes needed to be cut as it could be argued more scenes needed to be added/rearranged,  Plot development was bad, The build to the climax was very good as it mirrored the first movie but the actual ending was terrible and the choices the director made made zero sense (especially the final 15 minutes), The Michael Corleone Story was Bad (even though it could be argued it needed to be made, the route they went for his decline was just horrible and really ruined last act of his character. Overall, a bad movie that is a clear cash grab by using the Godfather name as it a simple/dull movie that is horribly cut and contains many amatuer elements, and while a third movie did need to be made it was clear that it was too late as they way this movie was presented makes it so distant from the previous two (making the audience start to see the downfall in Francis Ford Coppalas abilities).",06/11/2021,201,tt0099674,2.0

Overall, a great movie that is both a simple, yet complex modern retelling of Swan Lake that looks into the obsession of an artist and how far one will go to polute their innocence to become the best, even though it was told in a very simple, direct way that the screenplay was shaped.",06/21/2021,202,tt0947798,4.5

Overall, a good movie that is a fun watch that is driven by its performances but is held back alot by it being a very simple retelling of what actually happened (even if some of the events were exaggerated).",06/21/2021,203,tt0964517,4.0
Scarface (1983 film),7.6,"Medicore Direction (Good at moments (like the iconic ones) but pretty bad at others), Medicore acting overall (Pacino gives an Good to Very Good iconic performance (but its pretty one dimensional and his accent is horrible, most of the actors have a terrible cuban accent), Good Story, Medicore Screenplay with great/iconic moments (there are very iconic lines and moments but a lot fo the dialogue/writing is very bland/direct), Very 80s score (not that much of a fan tbh), Plot development was pretty good overall but it only talks about his rags and is riches (really misses out on the rags TO riches part), Great Production Design, build to the climax was good (mostly because it kinda just takes you there and is not a gradual build overall) with the climax being one of the best parts of the movie, decent editing/sound, Runtime was pretty long but it is not used that well because it focuses too much on the ends of the story and not the middle, the mood and vibe of the movies is extremely 80s (probably the most 80s movie I have ever seen). The character of Tony Montana is a great one that is a ""Rags to Riches to fallen from grace"" character with iconic mannerisms (though he is not as great of a character as everyone makes him to be as he is pretty one-dimension/over-the-top even in moments where he shows his more sensitive side). Overall, a decent, fun watch with very iconic momements that is an embodiment of the 80s but overall a very overrated movie that is not that well carried out as people make it to be (a true Valley in its rags to riches story).",07/01/2021,204,tt0086250,3.0

Overall, A movie was brilliant moments and brilliant aspects that is dragged down by its extremely long runtime and slow pace; despite all of this, the movie was great as it explores the relationship between family and profession against the backdrop of a space expoloration epic in one of Nolan's finest momements (even though he may faulter at times).",07/05/2021,207,tt0816692,4.5

Overall, a Very Good to Great Movie that details a fictional portrayed of the Candian Caper operation and the rescuing of the Iranian Hostages, with the fabrication from the real story being one of main detractors from how good the movie is (espeically cause it said it was ""based on a true story"").",07/11/2021,208,tt1024648,4.5

Overall, a great movie that was a real trendsetter for movies to come after with this Tarentino-esqe dialogue action, violence, and storytelling, but it a bit overrated considering it was a major reason for better movies to come after.",07/11/2021,209,tt0110912,4.5

Overall, a pretty good to good movie that was very entertaining to watch the character devolve from a consumer lifestyle to a point where he loses himself in a modern day retelling of ""Catcher in the Rye"" (Which is kinda a reason for why I did not like parts of the movie cause it was extremely annoying).",07/19/2021,210,tt0137523,3.5

The Wrestler (2008 film),9.3,"Great Direction, Acting was different based on importance (Incredible Performance by Mickey Rourke, Very Good to Great performance by Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood was decent to pretty good (Some moments were good and some moments were pretty bad), rest of the cast were anywhere from pretty bad to pretty good), Great Story (the plot develops into seeing how being past his prime has an effect on the ram as he tries to escape loneliness), Very Good to Great screenplay (With some moments being incredible with the dialogue and symbolism and some moments being pretty iffy), Cinematography on the spectrum (nausiating a lot of the times, but the single camera action does help show the loneliness of the Ram), Score use was subtle, Great film editing/sound editing to show how the Ram still views/hold onto his life as a wrestler even though he is well past his prime (best scene to show this was his walkup to working his first shift at the deli), pacing was good towards the ends of the movie but the third act out of 4 felt really slow and dragging at times, runtime was good (no need to add/cut scenes,maybe in that third act), the build to the climax was a full 180 and very sudden (not executed very well overall) but the actual climax of the movie was its best moment, climax/ending of the movie was incredible and extremely well done as you see how the Ram comes to terms with the choices he has made and the path he sets for himself (espeically of how he views his relationships with his lover and his daughter/ his relationship with the fans), the character of the Ram was very well written as a lost soul who clings onto the highs of his life but instead dives deeper into the loneliness of humanity, very accurate representation of wrestling and wrestling technique. Overall, a Great to Incredible movie that shows the loneliness of clinging to the past and the eventual hole you can never get out of as we view the life of the Ram trying to come to terms with his despite the best parts of his wrestling career being behind him (though the third act out of 4 was not as well executed as I would have liked it to be).",07/24/2021,212,tt1125849,4.5
Leaving Las Vegas,4.9,"Decent Direction, Acting was different based on importance (Very Good to Great performance by Nic Cage (In a Nic Cage Way; the most Nic Cage performance I have ever seen), Good Performance by Elizabeth Shue (Dull in terms of execution of dialogue but very good in terms of actions and gestures), Everyone else was very bad to pretty bad), Pretty Good Story (Like the way it flows and the story is told from the perspective of the end), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was very poorly written but the actual actions the characters take were good and I liked; no major symbolism), Score/Songs were very Vegas-esqe with this jazzy sound and not necessarily bad but were just way extremely overbearing in the film and took away from the story, Terrible Sound because of the fact of how overbearing the score/music was in the story in the story and how it made it incredibly hard to hear the diagloue at times, Decent Cinematography (espeically for it being super low budge) Good Film Editing (Liked some of the metaphors it placed with the different cuts), The pacing of the movie was very bad and incredibly slow (the first 10-20 minutes of the movie was meant to be the prologue but was just way to long and slow in terms of developing the story and characters), the runtime was at just under 2 hours but definitely could have cut the movie by like 30 minutes to make the movie have a better pace and remove a lot of unnecessary scenes, the build to the climax was like not really there but kinda there (not executed that well overall), The relationship that the two leads have is decent and not bad but like its two formulaic and safe, Nic Cages character well like a decent character was just way too Nic Cage in terms of its mannerisms and acting (you will know when you see it) but the portrayal of an suicidal alcoholic was not that bad, the movie was completely forumlaic overall (Scene of dialogue and action -> Overbearing Jazz score that pans to the either Vegas of the characters -> Songs with the same panning -> Fades to black to the next sequence). Overall, a bad movie as its only saving grace is to see the performance that won Nic Cage an Oscar (In the most Nic Cage way he could do it) and nothing else because the entire movie would have been awful it was not for him as this low budget film really could have been saved by the material (which was not that great to begin with).

Space Jam,7.2,"Pretty Bad Direction, Bad Acting overall (Decent Performance by MJ, Good Performance by Bill Murray, Pretty Good to Good by Wayne Knight, everyone else was very bad), Voice Acting was Great by the entire Looney Tones Cast and Danny Devito, Good Story, Screenplay two halves (Looney Toon Parts were great and very similar to its traditional style, Real life parts were bad to pretty bad overall; there were some good references and jokes that I did appricate (Mighty Ducks, Pulp Fiction, Patton, etc.)), Pretty Good Cinematography (made it feel very animated), Pretty Good animation and stiches with real life (especially for the time) as it gives it a pretty cartoony, Decent to Pretty Good Score (Liked how it incorporated Looney Toons elements), Good Soundtrack, Decent Editing/Sound, Pacing was very fast and really rushed between plot elements, Runtime was very short (defintitely could have used 15-20 minutes in the rising action as the film goes from exposition to the climax), a skip to the build in climax, the actual basketball game (climax) was exected very well as it was the best part of the movie and gives off a good message to the audience, the movie is pretty surface level but the majority of it is geared towards kids and people who wanted to MJ so i give it a pass. Overall, a decent, fun watch that was geared mostly for kids as it was good to see how two icons (MJ in the NBA and Bugs Bunny in Looney Toons) were able to come toghether to give off alot of iconic moments with the battle with the monstars as the movie does not try to take itself too seriously.

Overall, a Great to Incredible Movie that shows some of the dangerous and true natures of India while highlighting some of its beauty as Danny Boyle pulls off an incredible rendition of ""Indian Forrest Gump"" by loosly basing a story from the source material to show a bollywood rendition of the ""rags to riches"" trope in what is an incredible watch.",08/01/2021,215,tt1010048,4.5
Magnolia (film),7.9,"Very Good Direction, Very Good acting overall by the cast (Incredible from Tom Cruise (Though he was literally just playing himself), Great from Macy, Very Good to Great from Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman was Very Good to Great, John C. Reilly was Very Good to Good, Philip Baker Hall was very good to Good, rest were either pretty bad to good), Pretty Good Story (The way the store points ran parallel in narrative but intersected at many points throughout the movie; though, it does faulter in the last 20-30 minutes), Good Screenplay (There is alot of symbolism throughout the movie which I really enjoyed but the dialogue was just very basic, unnatural, and hard to watch), Good Score, Great Film Editing, Decent to Pretty Good Sound, Great Cinematography, Pacing was extremely slow (espeically dragging at some points) in the first half of the movie and extremely fast in the second half, the runtime of the movie is extremely long even with the 8 different stories (2-3 of the stories should have been cut to make a more polished product), the build to the climax was great and executed very nicely but the actual climax was a 180 from what it was building to and completely threw off the flow and experience of the movie (like I get why PTA did it but it still was just very poorly executed and threw off the movie for no reason), the ending of the movie was very poor as it had to pick up the pieces of its very weird climax and only tied up the loose ends for like half of the stories (leaving the other half unfinished and questioning), The conveying of tramua and emotions was pretty good and well executed as many of the characters are guilted and haunted by their pasts but at times it felt like the acting was a bit over the top; this also ties in with the use of the symbols as it explains these moments of trauma very well. Overall, a Pretty Good movie that has a lot of great moments and shows how the different characters lives intersect as they deal with their past trauma, but it faulters from its inconsistent pace, terrible use of runtime (Given that it is extremely long and still does not manage to tie up loose ends), and very questionable ending (Something I see alot from PTA).",08/09/2021,216,tt0175880,3.0

Overall, a Pretty Good movie that contains a lot of iconic moments and is a fun watch as we see the protagonist try to live some of his last moments of youth before growing up, but the movie is still pretty shallow with its content as it reeks of the 80s (especially with its subjects and meta storytelling).",08/16/2021,217,tt0091042,3.5
Field of Dreams,7.8,"Pretty Good to Good Direction, Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good to Good by Costner (Kinda has the same expression throughout the movie (not bad but very static), Good to Very Good by Madigan and James Earl Jones, rest were medicore to decent), Decent to Pretty Good Story (Though a majority of the movie stems away from the actual subject of the film as the film takes about 40 minutes into a pointless sidequest), Pretty Good Screenplay (Has iconic lines and good moments but the rest of the dialogue reeks of the 80s and kinda bland), Great Score, Good Film Editing, Pretty Good Cinematography, Pacing was extremely fast in the beginning then pretty good in the middle and then pretty slow towards the end with a very abrupt ending, the runtime was on the shorter side but was very poorly used as there definitely could've been 10-20 minutes added towards the climax/resolution, the build to the climax was very abrupt as you realize you missed the climax right as it is about to end, the ending of the movie was decent to pretty good with everything coming back full circle (As all the points come to the purpose of Kevin Costner's character), the symbolism and themes throughout the movie are very romantic/hopeful as it makes you believe in a heavenly body experience as you romanticize about baseball. Overall, a Decent to Pretty Good movie that makes you root for the characters and gets very emotional at times as you go through a baseball themed adventure but is very overatted as the film does not use its runtime effectively and stems away from the subject/purpose of the movie.",08/16/2021,218,tt0097351,3.0
The Suicide Squad (film),8.7,"Very Good Direction, Very Good acting by the cast overall (Very Good to Great from Elba, Robbie, and Slyvester Stallone (Voice Acting, little bias though), Very Good from Kinnaman), Pretty Good to Good Story (though a bit formulaic by combining pieces from the original movie and Guardians of the Galaxy; also while I liked that there were misdirections/twists I felt it was a bit too many by the end), Very Good to Great Screenplay (Very Tarentino-Esqe as it is serious but is filled with great comedic dialogue to break tension; really liked how they used CGI/effects as a part of the storytelling), Decent Score, Good Soundtrack (Though the mix with old and new songs kinda clashed at times for me), Incredible Visual Effects/Editing (really liked how they used CGI as a part of the storytelling; liked the visual gore style cause it showed a blend of booth cartoony yet realistic), Good Cinematography, Great Production Design, Pacing was good to very good (a bit quick at the end but nothing terrible), Build to the climax was very good with the overall climax being very well executed (bit long though), runtime was ok but 10-15 minutes of the movie could have been cut (especially at the end), the major flaws of the movie were that it was extremely formulatic as the storytelling was basically a carbon-copy of Guardians of the Galaxy (with it having a comedic relief character non-human who speaks few words and a ex-pro wrestler being the tough guy) with the story of the original Suicide Squad and the gore of Invincible. Overall, a very fun watch that makes me have confidence in the direction DC is going with their movies that has very creative story telling, great characters, and great action sequences, even though it was very formulaic and a very similar/close-copy to Guardians of the Galaxy (which makes sense given its James Gunn).",08/24/2021,219,tt6334354,4.0

Overall, a great movie that starts off very rough (a true slow burn) as it is an excellent portayal of finding one's self as they deal with personal struggles as we get a snapshot of a friendship exploring wine country looking for love, something that could have really been polished if the exposition was a bit tighter (making the movie possibly a 9.4-9.5).",08/27/2021,220,tt0375063,4.5

Overall, a fun, iconic horror movie that made the most that it could from its very low budget by creating iconic moments and characters, even though it suffers from a poorly misued plot structure that spends the first hour in dragging, expositition moments.

Overall, a movie with great visuals and the presentings of a great space epic that acts as more of a prologue and beginning of a story than a full movie, though it does suffer from bad storytelling that makes the movie hard to follow.

Overall, a classic in the hour genre that lives up to the name as many iconic elements of the movie make Psycho a must watch for the slasher genre (especially considering how ahead of its time it was), even though it does have a good amount of filler elements.",11/08/2021,224,tt0054215,4.5
American History X,8.6,"Good Direction (while a lot of the conversational moments with smaller character or extras was pretty bad, the more important moments and grand scale moments were carried out very well), Acting on the Spectrum (Incredible from Edward Norton (range of emotions, furiousity, and ephipany were carried out very well), Edward Furlong was Pretty Good (Good in some moments and Pretty bad and emotionless in others), Minor characters were pretty good to decent, extras and very small characters were pretty bad), Pretty Good to Good Story (Really liked the way the story was filtered between flashbacks in B&W and current in color, the fall and redemption of Vinyard was a bit formulaic, but the story towards the end really was carried out very well to show the message of the story), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (Symbols were a bit overt (though they were good in what they were trying to show) and the dialogue was very meta and forced), Pretty Good Score, Great to Incredible Cinematography (especially the way to show flashback being B&W (showing Vineyards past of seperating color) with the present being in color (to show Vineyards future to look at multiple facets)), Great to Incredible Editing (helping with the cinematography), plot structure was good as it is a story that mixes past and present to move the story forward, the pacing was very good (nothing to really take out), the build to the climax was very good as the climax of the movie really shows the true nature of how life really is, it was the correct decision to end the movie at the climax as it really leaves the audience understanding how life really is, the character and arc of Derek Vinyard is facinating as (though formulaic) as it shows the way influence has in corrupting the mind and it is only through self-exploration that real thoughts can be formed, the message of the film is very clear and a good way to end the movie as it shows how America is a nation filled with flaws from Racism though the beauty is try to overcome and learn from this (even though everyone is not ready to do so). Overall, a good watch to show the importance influence can have on corrupting the mind as we go through the story of Derek Vinyard (through an incredible and powerful performance from Edward Norton) to see how America is a nation filled with flaws and it is up to us to learn from and overcome these flaws (even though some may not be ready to do so), even though the movie may be meta and simple and representation in this message.

Overall, a Great movie that is incredible for the first 3/4 as you get to see Martin Scorsese work in his natural element to create one of the mob movies that defined him as you go through the life of Henry Hill and his rise in crime, though the final 1/4 of the movie felt dragging and underdeveloped (leaving the audience not as satisfied as they were throughout the film).",11/23/2021,229,tt0099685,4.5

Overall, a decent to pretty good movie to showcase the youth of the 70s in the movie that put Matthew McConaughey on the map, even though it may be a bit overatted and boring at many points.",11/24/2021,230,tt0106677,3.0

Overall, a very poorly executed movie that cannot be saved by performances from Lady Gaga and Adam Driver as the direction, screenplay, tone, and terrible acting make this movie extremely hard to watch and a mess overall.",11/30/2021,231,tt11214590,1.5

Overall, a defining comic-book movie that is filled with action, humor, and sadness as we get to see some familiar faces get second chances and get the closure they never did with both their characters and their careers.",12/23/2021,233,tt10872600,4.5

Overall, a great remake of the original as we get to hear and see new faces, and old, carry out iconic characters and numbers as this new rendition pays homage to the original in may ways while also holding its own as it brings back the flair and numbers that make West Side Story one of the most well-known musicals of all time.",12/25/2021,235,tt3581652,4.5

Overall, a good watch that stands the test of time as we get to see George Bailey find out the true importance of life and how valuable it really is in this Christmas classic, even though it falters in its plot structure taking away from its best elements.

Overall, a fun movie to watch that is filled with many memorable quotes and good laughs, but what holds the movie back is it reeking of the 00s Rom Com archetype with its predictable story and constant cliches, so it would probably be a fun movie to watch in the background or picking it up in the middle on TV.",12/31/2021,237,tt0396269,3.0

Overall, a good movie that is carried by the strong performances of the entire cast as we get to see a rare insight into deaf culture, though the movie is held back by it playing way too much to the coming-of-age genre through its cliches and predictable plot.",01/01/2021,238,tt10366460,4.0

Overall, a movie carried by Andrew Garfield as he transforms himself into Jonathan Larson as he tells the story of building a legacy and to keep on going (even if you never get to see your success), though it held back by some of its numbers, limited acting/direction, and very bad CGI.

Overall, a great movie and a very fun watch as we get to see these young characters grow through the different adventures they go on as PT Anderson delivers a great hangout movie that shows why he is one of the most respected filmmakers in the business by getting the most out of his script and elevating very new actors.

Overall, a movie that has the potential to set up a good new Batman film series but suffers from a lot of flaws in its first encounter; it will be interesting to see where we are taken next as we follow this new, darker version of Batman.",03/12/2022,244,tt1877830,3.5

Plot Structure was very nice as each segment had its purpose in progressing the story forward, Pacing was good as it kept a consisent pace (with no scenes really needed to be cut), the build to climax was very typical of movies from this time (so pretty good), climax was good as it was more important in how it is revelations for the characters rather than the action present, tone was set very nicely through the different motifs present as the mix of comedy/apocalypse/sleep-over/religous concepts brought something new and fun to see, the reliance on improv was fun to see as it really made the movie more about the characters interacting with each other and building jokes on each other rather than the story itself. Overall, an incredibly funny movie that is a masterclass in improv from some of the most prominent comedic actors of the early 2010s as we got to see how well they work with each other to make a very diasterous scenario fun.",03/16/2022,246,tt1245492,4.5
King Richard (film),8.6,"Good to Very Good Direction (Cut the right anecdotes and story points to help show the relationship between Richard and his family; got a good amount out of the actors in their scenes, though it felt like there were some points where their was some idle points/awkwardness with the more minor characters), Pretty Good Acting overall (Incredible Acting by Will Smith (Really transforms into the character of Richard Williams as the transformation of harshness to compassion for his family is fluid throughout the entire movie), Good to Very Good from Aunjanue Ellis (Was a good scene partner to Wll Smith and had moments where she could show off her ability as well), Good from Jon Bernthal (Was more of a minor role but played it very well), decent to pretty good from the rest of the cast), Very Good to Great Story (Outlines the impact that Richard has on the careers of his daughters as his fire and compassion help fuel their tennis careers; the issue with the story is that it is a bit revisionist as it is told from the perspectives of the Williams family (given the sister's roles as Executive producers) and sugarcoats a lot of his horrible nature and kinda makes up some aspects to make it work for the drama; despite this revisionist history, I feel the story still stayed mostly true to what happened and used tennis terminology very well (especially the William's use of open stance and throwing a spiral football for their serve)), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (A bit simple in its dialogue but gets the job done in terms of moving the story forward, some of the lines feel a bit forced as the foreshadowing is very overt), Score was present, Soundtrack was fine but gave the tone a bit more of a happy go lucky type (which I personally am not too much of a fan of), Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Plot Structure was laid out very nicely as each element builds off of each other as we see the progression through Venus (as well as Serena) through their come up in the tennis world, Pacing was good as there really was not any moments where the movie felt like it was rushed or dragging (no need to cut any time), the build to climax was good as it was really building throughout the whole movie (Venus going pro), climax was good as it helped show how cut throat the tennis world can be (even for a prodigy), tone of the movie was a bit too happy go lucky/feel-good and becasue of this I felt it really took away from some of the serious/angry moments of Richard Williams, a major problem of the movie was that it is really told from the perspective of Richard Williams and because of this it sugar-coats him and kinda takes away from some of the anger he really had when he worked with the media and others (though it does humanize him which was good to see as he really was trying to make his daughters the best); I did like they focused more on Venus because she really gets overshadowed by the success that Serena has gotten over the years. Overall, a movie that is fueled by the best performance that Will Smith has ever given as he transforms himself a compassionate father that wants his daughters to succeed, though it does falter from his feel-good tone and its revisionist history given that it is told from the Williams' family perspective (though it gets a lot of small details right which I do applaud).",03/21/2022,247,tt9620288,4.0
No Time to Die,8.4,"Very Good Direction (Was able to choreograph the fight and action scenes very well as well as the interpersonal dialogue heavy scenes), Good Acting overall (Very Good to Great from Daniel Craig (A good send-off performance for the character he is most known for as he really takes command of every scene he is in (though there are some small minor hiccups that take this from going above and beyond his other Bond performances), Good from L√©a Seydoux (A good scene partner and love interest to Bond), Good to Very Good from Lashana Lynch (Was able to make the most out of the dialogue she was given as she plays the up-incoming, hotshot trope well), Very Good from Ana de Armas (even though she was barely in the movie, she plays her ditsy, Bond girl character very well), Very Good from Jeffrey Wright (A nice return from a memorable Bond character as Wright pays to his strengths very well with this performance), Pretty Bad performance from Rami Malek (It felt very lazy and his overall acting and mannerisms did not feel that menacing as a Bond villian), Good from the rest of the main cast (though some questionable performances from some of the minor villians)), Pretty Good to Good Story (The layout of Bond coming out of retirement and why certain pieces tie toghether make it be a good closure to the whole Daniel Craig Bond Saga; though there were some questionable story elements towards the end (filed with predictable cliches), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (some of the dialogue was fine but there were some elements where it was easy to predict what was going to be said and what was coming up; it was very obvious where Phoebe Waller-Bridge came in to edit the score to add more comedic elements because it just felt very forced and not funny (though some of the wittier/typical Bond jokes did hit), Very Good to Great Score (took elemets of old Bond themes while also captured new themes to make it work well (this was Hans Zimmer after all), Very Good Cinematography, Great Sound (Really enjoyed the moments where Bond's hearing is recovering in a fight from close proximity to an explosion), Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects, Plot Structure was good for the most part (I felt the exposition really help play into the trust issues for bond, but I feel like the resolution was very lackluster), Pacing was good because even though it was a long movie the pacing was consistent for the most part (no need to cut anything), the build to climax was good because it was clear what was needed and how it was important to the story, climax was executed very nicely in terms of action (but in terms of story it was a bit cliche and predictable), tone was constant for the most part because it tried to be the typical bond movie (but like an older bond who is coming out of retirement one last time (though the break in tone for the comedy scenes were really annoying), the finishing touches for Craig as bond were displayed very well throughout the movie as you can see him make peace with his time as the character as he shows his experience but also shows his closure at the same time. Overall, a nice conclusion to Daniel Craig as James Bond as we get to see him close out the character on his own terms in a very action packed, emotional manner, but the movie does not really compete with his other movies like Skyfall and Casino Royale due to the subpar screenplay/story and questionable performances from Rami Malek and some of the minor characters.",03/25/2022,248,tt2382320,3.5

Overall, a very well made and written movie that looks at the effects of holding on to trauma and the importance of letting go as we see all the characters be parts of a well oiled machine, but where the movie really fails its extremely long runtime and mismanaged plot structure as it really feels like the movie is dragging a lot (something the viewer has to get past to see the hidden beauty).",03/27/2022,249,tt14039582,4.0

Overall, a movie that is very artistic in its use of subtly and production design as we follow a cowboy come to terms with his own identity, but even though the movie is well made, it faulters from relying too much on subtly and ultamitely leaves the audience with more questions in the end.",04/06/2022,250,tt10293406,4.0

Jackson (had limited range throughout the performance but it was easy to see where he had to let go of the direction he was given), Good to Very Good from Ian McDiarmid (Embodied the emperor very well and was able to switch sides very easily), Great voice acting (really brought to life the iconic performances of their characters), Bad from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (The actual structure and storyline was very well told cause it really bridges the descent Anakin has in being the chosen one to falling to the darkside through the illusion that it will help Padme (especially in the final hour)), Bad Screenplay to where it is memorable and iconic (None of the language was natural and felt very forced (but there are just so many memorable lines from how bad they were written that I loved it; the foreshawdowing and symbolism actually is told very well (giving further proof that Lucas is a good Storyteller but terrible dialogue writer), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (One of the best John Williams scores he has ever made), Great to Incredible Cinematography (especially in the scenes where the subjects are small pieces of a large canvas), Great to Incredible Visual Effects (Especially considering when the movie was made and a majority of it is through Greenscreen and effects), Good Editing (The cuts between different shots was Great but the transitions between scenes felt very lazy), Incredible Production Design, Incredible Makeup, Incredible Costumes, Plot Structure was laid out very nicely as all the elements really built off of each other and every element played an importance, Pacing was great as it really kept a steady pace throughout (with no need to add or cut on runtime), the build to climax was incredible as the final our of the movie was building to the fall of the jedi, climax was incredible as it was one of the best moments in Star Wars history (especially the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan fight), tone was very typical of the prequels and Star Wars (but the darker tones were a night touch as it brough a depressing aspect with glimpses of hope), the movie was a real redemption for the prequels as we already expected the bad aspects of the movie yet we were still suprised the grandure and level of story writing which makes this movie an iconic story in the Star Wars saga. Overall, An incredible story with the technical achievements that really make this movie a must watch and a favorite of mine as it helps bridge the prequels with the original triology, even though it does reek of the bad dialogue and direction that the rest of the prequels suffer from.",05/11/2022,255,tt0121766,5.0

Overall, a highly anticipated Marvel movie that plays too strongly to its predecessors as it is very formulaic in the MCU boilerplate and has pretty poor writing overall, but has some highlights when it comes to acting, direction, visuals, and new stylistic choices that make it a bit different from other MCU movies (even though by not a lot).",05/23/2022,256,tt9419884,3.0

Overall, a epic that is a good watch filled with many good performance, great cinematography, and well carried out action scenes, but is still simplistic given the plot and how cliche/predictable it got at times.",05/24/2022,257,tt11138512,4.0

Overall, a movie with highlights in John Travolta's performance, soundtrack, and dancing sequences, but really has some misses in other aspects as it misses the mark in terms of its writing and other performances.",05/30/2022,258,tt0076666,3.0

Overall, a great introduction into the Lord of the Rings Triology as the execution and different parts are well done to start this epic story off as the audience is left wanting more from the characters and the story as they transition into the next part.",05/30/2022,259,tt0120737,4.5

also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villian to be scared of), Very Good from the rest of the cast), Brilliant Story (Created a world that is one of the most iconic today;

moreover, helps provide some insight into Luke's quest in finding the force and taking his first step in becoming a Jedi, tone was that typical to a Space Opera or Science Fiction Epic but does have some unique feel to it that makes it very Star Wars, a ground-breaking movie not only in Cinema-history but actual history as well as it ushered in a new way to view and create stories and was an inspiration for the rise in the Science-Fiction genre in the 80s and 90s.

Overall, a movie that is a very good watch and has things to watch for (like direction and acting) as we get to see Dustin Hoffman enter the Hollywood scene with a very comedic movie that is groundbreaking in the rom-com genre, but the film suffers from a very imbalanced plot stucture as it favors the Mrs.Robinson relationship a lot more than it should.",06/14/2022,264,tt0061722,4.0

Overall, an impactful movie for its time that is shot very well but is so poorly written that it is really hard to watch at times, and the movie is a copy of Superbad and it really shows.",06/17/2022,265,tt1636826,2.0

Jordan were not the best but besides that she was able to hold her own), Decent from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (Some elements of the story were way too safe/mismanaged (the overall plot of fighting from the perspective of Creed (like the default in the first fight)), but I did enjoy the elements when it came to Rocky (and how it closed the character's story line), Drago (and how his story closed his arc from Rocky 4), and the Baby), Decent Screenplay (The scenes when it came to Rocky and Drago were very well written and had that charm of the old movies, but all the scenes regarding just Creed and his relationship with other characters (besides Rocky) were pretty poorly written/felt unnatural), Good Score (mixed the allusions to the original movies nicely), Very Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Visual Effects, Good Makeup, Plot Structure was a bit mismanged as it felt they were trying to fit in a little too much into this movie and did not have enough time to do so (though the moments from building to the climax to the resolution were executed very well), Pacing was alright, the build to climax was very typical of Rocky but was overall very good (a real turning point for the movie), climax had decent execution (it was basically the same as the last movie), tone was a little bit too much of that of a sports movie when Rocky is really not about that (Rocky is about someone finding themselves (it just happens to be in the context of Boxing), and the touch of becoming a father was nice but really does not help too much in this regard), the emotional touches of this movie were well done and the film was an overall good conclusion to the Rocky Balboa Character as he gets closure in something he has been hoping for for so long.

she also really grows as a character from being the damsel in distress to being a loving leader), Good to Very Good Billy Dee Williams (really becomes a memorable presense in all the scenes he is in with his cool nature that conflicts/competes with Han, though there is some hiccups in delivery as he is still getting used to the Star Wars universe as opposed to the other members of the cast), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast;

also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship; and really grows the character to show how loving he is towards his new friends), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villian to be scared of), Great to Incredible from Frank Oz (really brought the character of Yoda to life with puppeteering and the vocal performance, Very Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (Really sets up different elements of the universe very nicely and uses the concept of parallel storylines very well;

moreover, one of the most important lines in history is delivered in this climax that make Star Wars as a franchise memorable, tone does not play as much into the Space Opera or Science Fiction Epic as the last one but does have shades of it; feels more like a standout movie that really transcends genre in many ways (while still keeping the same Star Wars charm), really can be felt of as a stand alone movie (even though it leaves so much to be answered with its ending) as we get to see the rise and fall of the characters as they must continue their own indivdual quests to grow as characters.

Overall, a good movie that is well made and driven by its Director and lead actor (Johnny Depp) as it is fun to see us go into the world of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but it suffers from a mismanaged plot structure to the point where the final 30 minutes really feels like a chore to go through.",07/04/2022,273,tt0367594,3.5

Overall, a movie that has a huge following and big impact on the sci-fi genre as it begs many questions about humanity and what it means to be alive, but does not live up to such a high billing as it is poorly executed by its director and actors to the point that is is pretty hard to pay attention and watch due to how boring it is.",07/15/2022,278,tt0083658,2.5

Overall, a movie that is poorly executed and cannot be saved with Thor's charm as it tries too hard to be funny with its meta jokes and constant volume of jokes (even when it most do not work) as this takes away from actually building a storyline that should really be developed, the relationship between Thor and Jane and how Thor comes to terms with being at the end of his character arc.",07/15/2022,279,tt10648342,2.0

Decent to Pretty Good Direction (Directs the movie as if it is a early 2010s comedy (which kinda is a big drawback given its almost a decade later, but does a good job in moving the story foward and getting a good amount out of his characters), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Nicholas Cage (He is basically playing himself in an exaggerated way so there really is not that much room for error, Good from Pedro Pascal (Does a good job in building off of Cage as someone who admires the actor's work (While also showing his ability to act as well), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (It is a fun concept that can only go so far but the movie does a good job in being entertaining for what it is (Though it is filled with many cliches to make it very feel-good and the style the movie is trying to emulate), Pretty Good Screenplay (Overall simplsitic screenplay with good funny momements that make the movie entertaining), Score was very typical of 2010s movies in how it is used, Pretty Good Cinematography (was a fan of the filter they used throughout the movie), Decent Sound (Similar to that of other action comedies), Decent Editing, Decent Visual Effects, Plot Structure was nicely laid out and very safe in that it is similar to other action comedies, Pacing was a bit on the faster side at some points but is overall pretty nice (no need to add or cut any material), the build to climax was very cliche and very similar to that of other action comedy movies of the 2010s, climax was entertaining in how a action comedy can be, tone was way too much like that of a early 2010s action comedy movie (which is kinda troubling given that this movie comes out after a decade later). Overall, an entertaining movie that has some funny moments and noticable acting (especially with Nic Cage), but reeks too much like a early 2010s comedy to the point where it feels very dated in its style (that is this movie would be a lot better if it came out 10 years earlier.",08/20/2022,289,tt11291274,2.5
John Wick (film),6.7,"Pretty Bad Direction (The choreography of action sequences was very well done (Some of the best I have seen), but the moving of the story forward and the direction of actors was bad considering how dull the movie really is), Bad Acting (Pretty Good from Keanu Reeves (Able to handle the action sequences in a great way and is a strong prominent figure throughout the movie (With some good moments in dramatic acting), but has some really questionable scenes that may be in fault from the direction he was given), Acting On the Spectrum for the rest of the cast (Anywhere from very bad and emotionless (like Alfie Allen) to decent acting (like Willem Dafoe), Good Story (Though it is filled with cliches of an ex-conman coming back into the fold, the storytelling and character writting of John Wick is very good to paint him as the ultamite figure to not be messed with), Pretty Bad to Decent Screenplay (The dialogue was very bland but there were some good moments), Score was just present (but did help in the action scenes when present), Good Cinematography, Good to Very Good Sound, Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (When showing the firefights, Good Costumes (Even though it is just a suit, they really helped create an iconic character in John Wick), Plot Structure was decent for the most part (but does follow a typical action-movie one), Pacing was incredible fast to where the runtime was very short (But this helps in giving pace to the character of John Wick, the build to climax was prevenlant and noticable in its prep for the action, climax was well executed and a fun part of the movie, the tone of the movie was very dark and grungy (adds to that John Wick feel); but there is a lot of dryness from the deadpan that it kinda takes away from this, the action scenes of the movie were some of the best choreographed action scenes I have ever seen as it is just so physical and technical that it keeps the audience engaged and wanting more. Overall, a movie that is not so great in its own right with its lackluster direction, acting, and screenplay, but is an enjoyable watch because of its intense action scenes and character writting of John Wick (painting a character that will be fun to see what happens next to him).",08/21/2022,290,tt2911666,2.5

Overall, (Conclusion). Brilliant Score (Continues to takes what was great from the previous film and adds some new themes that really make this score stand out as well), Great to Incredible Cinematography (which really stands out in the Luke vs. Vader scene), Great Sound (especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life), and they fixed the delayed lightsaber sound issues from the previous film), Very Good to Great Editing, Pretty Bad to Decent Visual Effects (While there are some monumental, there is a wide use of bad Green Screen (which was easy to see), excessive use of pyrotechnics (to where it just got annoying); there are also many flaws from the new edition that were so painful to watch (example being the Jabba's palace scenes)), Incredible to Brilliant Production Design (Some of the best sets in all of Star Wars that are so iconic and well remembered in history, with the Tatooine/Endor sets being some of my favorite from the series), Incredible Makeup (helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context; also, the ewok cosumes were so adorable in how they were designed to where it added to us caring about them), Plot Structure went back to the linear stucture but does a good job in setting pieces toghether and making sure everything comes toghether in the end, Pacing was good and not too rushed or slow, the build to climax was good as it helped build the relationships between the different characters (Luke and Vader as well as Han and Leia), climax was a bit anticlimatic as even though they went for Luke to be the better man (it just did not have the flare that the previous movies had as it was meant more for closure in the characters rather than entertainment), tone goes back to being a mix of a Space Opera/Science Fiction epic as the movie really acts as the final act in the saga (needing the other two movie's support to keep it going), as a movie meant to close out the saga it does a good job in bringing closure to character arcs and stories (but this movie cannot really be a stand alone film). Overall, a step back from the previous Star Wars films by reverting back similar bad habits (with George Lucas's poor dialogue and over use of effects), but the movie does do a good job in ending the saga with its world-building and great storytelling (something that makes the Original Trilogy one of the most respected in movie history).",08/28/2022,291,tt0086190,4.0

Min (Really is not in the movie that long but does do a decent job in portaying a curious robot), Pretty Good to Good from Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja (Really plays the child character wanting something that is lost very well, shows a good amount of depth and is a real star from the movie), Bad from the cast (everything just feels emotionless and inexpereinced)), Pretty Good Story (With a shortened screentime, the movie makes no waste in trying to get the most out of its plot elements and progressing the story forward), Pretty Good Screenplay (the conversations of the movie did feel natural and of a technological utopian; the symbolism of the movie was good and did help show some limelight into the humanity of Artificial Intelligence), Score was very minimal and really did not play too much into the movie, Decent Cinematography, Pretty Bad Sound (made the silence of the movie pretty deafening), Decent Editing (felt a bit amaturish), Pretty Good Visual Effects (especially for how low the budget was), Pretty Good Production Design (helped bring that futuristic element to the movie), Plot Structure was very simplistic and laid out well (no bells and whistles), Pacing was a bit on the slower side at felt like it dragged a bit (if maybe 15 minutes of the movie was cut and the pacing was a bit faster then the movie would have been more captivating but it would also take away from its charm), climax was a bit anti-climatic (but it was necessary given what the movie does try to portay), tone played into the sci-fi elements which made it very much on the dull/slow-burn side so the movie was a bit hard to follow at times as it could get a bit boring (the lack of score/sound at many points defintiely added to this). Overall, a slow-burn that is a quick representation of how AI can make an impact on families as this family looks for the humanity of their artificial child, bringing in some interesting ideas but ultamitely ends up being a bit boring and hard to follow because of the very dull tone and lack of direction.

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,9.4,"Great Direction (Does a Great job at moving the story forward through the use of symbols and ideas that are very mature to a children's movie; really helps blend the fun nature of Puss in Boots with the serious nature of the plot and also fits in the fighting scenes very well to keep the audience engaged with what is going on), Very Good Acting (Great from Antonio Banderas (Really plays the role with experience but also adds depth in showing the more depressing side of Puss' life as he has to come to terms with his new reality), Very Good from Salma Hayek (Plays off the other castmates very well and does a good job in helping bring emotion of out Puss), Very Good from Harvey Guill√©n (Plays the adorable comic relief character very well and acts as the moral compass throughout the movie), Good from Florence Pugh, Pretty Good from John Mulaney (It was very obvious it was John Mulaney throughout the movie), Very Good from Wagner Moura (Played the true villian of the movie very well), Good from the rest of the cast), Great to Incredible Story (The actual story is very simple in that there a journey from point A to point B, but the sub-elements and the journey towards the end is very complex as the characters really find out what they want from life; the actual concept of the journey also stems from the fairy-tale aspect that made Shrek very famous but the use of it being Puss' last life was also a good touch), Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue is very clever and is written very well to have innuendos for both a younger and more mature audience; the symbolism and foreshadowing was great for a children's movie and really is a lot deeper than many children's movies have gone before), Pretty Good Score, Good Sound, Great Editing, Incredible Visual Effects/Animation (Really takes from the Spider-verse style and runs with it as it feels very cartoony with some shades of Anime (Something that is a breath of fresh air to the animated movie space); the fight scenes were were well animated and really enjoyable to watch), Plot Structure was laid out very well as all the elements flowed well into each other and the conclusion was met after everything was resolved, Pacing was very good as it did not really feel like any time was needed to be cut or added, climax was great as the fighting mixed with the animation made the scene very captivating, tone had elements that were similiar to a children's movie but also had elements that were from the hero's journey (with some mixes of depressing tones to show Puss' anxiety), a great representation of how anxiety and ego take effect on an individual as it masks Puss' fear of death very well with the backdrop of it being a children's movie (something not only few animated films have done but any film really). Overall, a movie that at the surface plays very well for children as it follows the iconic Puss in Boots on his adventure, but overall has a much stronger and deeper meaning of living life without fear and anxiety as the creators synergized incredible animation with great writing to make this movie a must watch.

Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,8.6,"Good Direction (Keeps a very similiar style to the previous film as he moves the narrative in a similar way and is able to get the most out of his actors again), Very Good Acting (The cast as a whole works well off of each other as Daniel Craig acts as the voice of reason to get the most out of these flawed humans), Good Story (The actual story is good and very on par to the first as the first, but the construction is a bit awkward with the story being told twice (just from different perspectives)), Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue is very whitty and the comedic elements do hit; the symbolism and foreshadowing is one of the better parts of the movie as it helps make it a true Who-done-it; the elements of the screenplay that were very topical were very annoying to see as it talked about COVID (which got really annoying)), Pretty Good Score (helped with setting the mood), Very Good Cinematography (Helps with creating the mystery and suspense), Good Sound (Helps with creating the mystery and suspense), Very Good Editing (Helped with creating mystery and the suspense), Pretty Good Visual Effects (Not one of the focal points of the movie but is good at keeping the movie intersting), Very Good Production Design (A stark contrast to the first film as that dealt more with wintery scenes while this movie tried to create a Summer vibe through its sets), Good Costumes (Helps with creating that summer feel), Plot Structure was kinda an issue with this movie as the movie tries to tell the story twice to show two different points of view (when the second point of view could have been half of the time as it mostly just drags the story), Plot Structure was kinda an issue with this movie as the movie tries to tell the story twice to show two different points of view (when the second point of view could have been half of the time as it mostly just drags the story), climax was very good as it helps build to show how flawed these characters are and how the truth is not super certain to be told, tone is very similiar in style to the previous film as it is still a who-done-it (but there are flavors to make the movie have more of a happier and jollier feel with it being set in the summer). Overall, a sequel that is pretty on par with the first as it takes many aspects (like the overall who-done-it style for a cast of flawed characters) while still trying to be different (like giving it more of a Summer feel), but does not live up entirely as the story construction (especially the retelling of the story) and topical nature of the movie (bringing up COVID) holds it back a bit.",01/16/2023,313,tt11564570,4.0
8 Mile (film),8.3,"Good Direction (Helps move the story pretty well and does a good job getting a good amount out of the main actors (but really falters when working with the supporting/minor characters); the direction really gets highlighted during the rap battle scenes as he is able to create such a captivating environment with scenes that are just so entertaining to watch), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Good from Eminem (Has some moments of inexperience but really plays the lead well as he draws from personal experience to help tell the story), Pretty Good to Good from Mekhi Phifer (Plays the best friend character well and is able to work with Eminem nicely), Pretty Good from Brittany Murphy (Is not really given that much to work with but does a pretty good job at playing the female lead well), Pretty Bad from Kim Basinger (Really suprising how poorly she plays this character given her last performance with this director won her an oscar; just does not hit any of the depressing notes that are needed from her character and does not work well with other actors), Pretty Good to Good from Michael Shannon (Really steals the show in the scenes he is in as he shows glimpses of an actors that will have acclaim in the future), Bad to Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of inexperience and lack of depth in any of the characters)), Very Good Story (The semi-autobiographical nature of the story really looks into Eminem's upbringing to show how hard it was for him to grow and make a name for himself in the rap community), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue is very simplistic and is a bit lacking in comparison to the other; the lyricism of the wraps are very well written and definitely a highlight of the movie; the foreshadowing and symbolism is a but surface level as the story really is meant to show the race divisions of Detroit and the Rap community), Great Score/Soundtrack (The score is just an interpolation of Lose Yourself but that song is just so good that this is a plus; the soundtrack), Pretty Good Cinematography, Good Sound (Really helped when mixing the hip-hop elements with the story), Pretty Good Editing, Plot Structure was pretty standard and boilerplate (the typical underdog story getting his shot at the end), Plot Structure was pretty standard and boilerplate (the typical underdog story getting his shot at the end), climax was great and the best part of the movie (it really shows how Rabbit finally gets the confidence to show off his lyricism as he spits some of the most famous bars not only in movie history but rap history), Tone was set well (helped with really establishing the scene and the grime of the ghetto in Detroit). Overall, an entertaining movie that has really great moments and showcases great hip-hop, all lead by a good performance from Eminem as he drives the movie to a great climax of Rap Battles, but is held back a bit from the pretty standard/boilerplate elements and not great performances from the minor characters.",01/18/2023,314,tt0298203,3.5
M3GAN,6.6,"Decent Direction (Moves the story well and does a good job setting the tone; but the cheap use of horror elements was very predictable, and the acting is not really the best), Pretty Bad Acting  (Decent to Pretty Good from Allison Williams (Holds her own decently well as the lead but really has no depth or emotion throughout the movie), Decent from Jenna Davis (There really is only one delivery level to the performance but there are no main issues), Decent from Violet McGraw, Bad to Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Really just a lot of inexperience and monotonous performances)), Pretty Bad Story (The story is pretty typical of regular horror movies of the same trope with the actual plot being pretty predictable), Pretty Bad to Decent Screenplay (Typical horror movie dialogue (though the jokes and non-sequitur moments were pretty funny); the symbolism and foreshadowing is really surface level), Decent Score (Used well in conjuction to help build suspense), Pretty Good Cinematography (Pretty standard but used well to help build the horror), Decent to Pretty Good Sound (Used to help build horror elements, but a bit overused to help rely on jumpscares), Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Good Visual Effects (With the budget they had, they did a good job in creating the animatronics), Plot Structure was kinda a fault of the movie as it spends a bit too much time on the exposition that it really pushes away building the conflict and the keeps the climax shorter than it could be, Plot Structure was kinda a fault of the movie as it spends a bit too much time on the exposition that it really pushes away building the conflict and the keeps the climax shorter than it could be, climax was pretty typical to horror movies with some action component, tone was pretty atypical of horror movies as well there are moments of suspense, the movie does do a decent job in incorporating comedic elements to lighten the tone. Overall, a movie that does a decent job at mixing horror elements with comedy, but falters when coming to direction, acting, and story as it is just a modern retelling of the possessed doll trope (which makes it pretty predictable).",01/20/2023,315,tt8760708,2.5
