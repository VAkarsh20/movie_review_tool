Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,8.1,"REDUX 09/04/22: Good to Very Good Direction (Able to move the story forward (though in a more cautious manner) and execute the action scenes very well; also does a pretty good job in getting the most of out his actors (though they are limited throughout the movie)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Felicity Jones (Able to command all the scenes she is in and be a very vocal leader with her cast and during the action scenes, though she does some limitations when it comes to the more powerful scenes), Good from Diego Luna (Able to hold his own for a majority of the movie and does well in the more action-packed scenes, but he shows his ceiling in many of the dramatic scenes), Very Good from Ben Mendelsohn (Able to play the villain role very well and shows range throughout the movie in being that menacing figure wanting more power), Great from Alan Tudyk (Really steals the show with his performance as he plays the smart-witted/comedic relief character), Decent from Forest Whitaker (Very over-the-top in his performance but does a good job in commanding the scenes he is in), Pretty Good to Good from Riz Ahmed (Plays the anxious character well but does show a bit of inexperience to where his character is not that believable), Decent from James Earl Jones (Something just feels very off from his performance (probably from the age), but he does do a good job in making Vader feel like a menacing presence), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (Just typical Star Wars level acting))), Very Good to Great Story (The architecture of the story is very well laid out and entertaining (even though there are massive deviations from the traditional storytelling), though the storytelling is a bit on the safer side and not as ambitious as other Star Wars movies; the story also does try to jam a lot into it and this takes away from building some of the side characters and their relationships to the story), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (While there were some iconic lines, a lot of this movie is filled with corny dialogue meant to build power (but just ends up being a bit more laughable); The character writing for some of the characters were really good but they introduce so many characters that it just waters down all the new introductions; the foreshadowing, symbolism, and allusions to A New Hope were very well executed as it helps paint a more holistic picture of the first Star Wars movie (especially painting the rebellion to be a bit more on the darker side)), Very Good to Great Score (Helps keep that Star Wars feel while adding new themes to the universe), Great Cinematography, Incredible Sound, Incredible Editing, Great to Incredible Visual Effects (Everything from this movie was incredible but the Deepfakes did show their age as it falls more into the uncanny valley now), Very Good Production Design, Very Good Makeup, Great Costumes (Helps pay homage to A New Hope's costumes), Plot Structure was very well executed from a macro level as it helps entertain the audience but there is a lot jammed into the movie that it takes away from helping build the characters and their importance (they are kinda just plopped into the story), Pacing was a bit on the faster side cause of how much they try to jam (if they cut like cut 30 minutes of new content/characters and used it to slow the pace and build up some of their characters the movie would have a bit better execution), Build to climax was very well done and is a bit similar to other blockbuster/Star Wars movies; climax was incredibly executed and the best part of the movie (whether it be from the fights on the ground or the fire fights), Tone of the movie is very similar to other Star Wars movies but the movie does have a bit of a unique feel that is separate, The movie does a great job in displaying fan service as it does a good job in showing the importance and elements of the original film (whether it be the allusions or the ending scene that is jaw-dropping in its execution). Overall, an entertaining movie that helps rejuvenate the Star Wars franchise through its well executed action scenes and fan-service to the original film, though it is filled with corny dialogue and introduction of too many new elements that it is not able to be on the same par as the original trilogy. ORIGINAL (8.5, 01/06/2017): Final Third of the movie was amazing, great action, great plot, has a gradual progression from slow to fast pace, not a memorable cast due to the fact that they all die.",2016,09/04/2022,1,tt3748528

La La Land,9.6,"REDUX 03/28/2023: Incredible to Brilliant Direction (Really does an amazing job in building this modern world filled with nostalgic pieces of old Hollywood; truly blends in different elements of story and acting help tell an iconic tale that highlights the golden era of Hollywood; the movie on a macro scale is phenomenal as it builds these lush sets for the music numbers, is also great at a micro scale as it helps build the dreams fo the two leads), Very Good to Great Acting (Great from Ryan Gosling (Does a great job in playing off of Emma Stone very well and also being this relic of old hollywood that is initially resistent to change, but changes over time the more he opens himself up to Mia), Great from Emma Stone (The real star of the show as she does a great job in being the hopeful actress who is starting to doubt herself; she really plays off of Gosling well as their chemistry is what really drives both of their performances (and the movie) forward), Very Good from the rest of the cast), Brilliant Story (The parallelism then divergence of both the leads in their dreams and their relationship really brought a sense of realism to what could actually happen (even in a fantasy world); everything that happened in the story of this movie I would not change as it is near perfect on so many accounts; in terms of an actual narrative structure, is is laid out very well with all the different elements of the plot labeled very nicely (in a way that mimics old hollywood)), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (The dialogue is just very natural yet has flavors of old hollywood; the symbolism is in incredible as it really helps with showing the meanings of the movie in terms of aspirations and love; the foreshadowing is some of the best I have ever seen in a movie as there are small symbols that are subtle touches that come out towards the end of the movie), Brilliant Score/Brillaint Soundtrack (My favorite use of music in a movie as it is weaved so perfectly into the film to build emotion and tone), Great Cinematography, Great Sound (Helps in giving it that Jazzy, old hollywood feel), Great Editing, Incredible Production Design (Helps in building the feel and tone of the movie), Very Good Costumes (More just about the dresses than the costumes in general, the strong colors really help in making the movie playful), Plot Structure is laid out perfectly as it does not say too far in any moment of the narrative arc; all the different elements are established very well (which kinda helps with the transition slides in the movie), Pacing was a consistent pace nothing feels like it is rushing or dragging (runtime is perfect as it is), Climax was very good as it is a climax in the main narrative of the movie; it is the resolution that is the best part of the movie as it shows the true message of the movie and what would actually happen (with it being executed so well), Tone was established very well as it is a very old hollywood/musical feel as many elements of the movie (production design, screenplay, music, sound, etc.) really come together to help give this feel. Overall, an Incredible movie that really is a strong homage to old Hollywood as almost all of the elements come together to tell this realistic dream of what may happen to those who chase their dreams in Hollywood, with the Direction, Writing, Score, and Production Design being major highlights in making this movie a modern classic. ORIGINAL (9.6, 01/10/2017): Incredible acting by both actors, Great chemistry, Incredible music, Incredible Story, Incredible Screenplay, Movie comes around full circle, Unpredictable ending, Ryan cannot sing, some points are kinda pointless.",2016,03/28/2023,4,tt3783958

The Other Guys,9.4,"REDUX 04/09/2022: Very Good Direction (Was able to blend the comedic and action elements very well), Good to Very Good Acting (Incredible from Will Ferrell (Incredible Chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlburg as both actors' strengths come out when working off each other), Incredible from Mark Wahlberg (See Will Ferrell), Great from Michael Keaton (Really steals the show in his over-the-top nature), Good from Steve Coogan, Good to Very Good from Samuel L. Jackson (In his very brief roles), Good to Very Good from Dwayne Johnson (In his very brief roles), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (At its core, the movie is pretty surface level in that cops are trying to make a break for themselves, but the typical Adam McKay and Will Ferrell story elements really make different elements of the story funny), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (One of the funniest movies I have watched due to the quotable jokes and how stereotypical of a Will Ferrell movie this is), Good Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Good Visual Effects, Plot Structure was very nice and laid out well, Pacing was good as it kept a consistent pace (with no scenes really needed to be cut, but some of the deleted scenes were very funny), Build to climax was very typical of movies from this time (so pretty good); climax was good (A generic mix of 2000s action with comedic elements), Tone was set very nicely as it followed the action comedy template very nicely. Overall, an incredibly funny movie that is incredibly quotable and a must watch for the jokes and the chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlburg as it is a pillar in the buddy cop genre that began to take over the early 2010s.

Requiem for a Dream,9.3,"REDUX 01/11/2022: Great to Incredible Direction (Aronofsky is able to get memorable performances out of his actors as they are elevated through is script, use of symbolism, and unique editing and cinematography), Great Acting (Brilliant from Ellen Burstyn (Delivers a career rebirth through this performance as she is able to completely transform herself into a fractured mother still looking to keep hold of her family that is fading away from her), Very Good from Jared Leto (Shows promise throughout the movie as he was able to handle the emotional moments very well (though does falter at times for a bit of a newer actor)), Very Good to Great from Jennifer Connelly (A performance that really helped shift her career in a different direction as she embodies an individual who is slowly becoming numb as she succumbs to her addictions), Good to Very Good from Marlon Waynes (A surprisingly good performance from the known comedic actor as he steps out of his comfort zone to play his character very well), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (Very well structured as we get to see how the characters slowly decline and succumb to their addictions), Great to Incredible Screenplay (Filled with great symbolism and imagery as well as great dialogue for the most part, there are some very questionable moments however), Incredible to Brilliant Score (really helped set the tone of the movie and is very iconic in its own-right), Incredible Cinematography (For the most part, as we get to see the camera help give perspective to the characters, though it can be very nauseating at times), Very Good Sound (Helped show the routine the characters went through as using the drugs just became a habit for them, though some of the sound choices were a bit cartoony and out of place), Incredible Editing (For the most part, the jump cuts and the scenes where the characters are getting high are very well conducted and helped create an artsy genre for the public to see, though some of the editing choices were questionable), Plot Structure was great as the movie is just a constant build to the climax with no resolution (something that was an intended message for the characters), Pacing was extremely fast (and while this was an intention, it still kinda made it a bit hard to follow), Build to the climax was incredible as the whole movie just builds to it; the climax itself is one of the most memorable parts of the movie as it shows how far all the characters went with their addictions and how there was no turning back anymore (something that was helped strengthened through there being no resolution), The movie is filled was incredible moments and does an incredible job with the low budget it is given but it is still filled with many flaws that showed why a movie like this was very unsuccessful went it came out (that and how grotesque it was). Overall, a must watch as Aronofsky puts himself on the mainstream map by crafting an incredible insight into the descent people go to fill the void of happiness they have as we get to see 4 characters spiral out of control through their addictions, though it is not a perfect movie as it is filled with many flaws (and but not it being it is nauseating and grotesque). ORIGINAL (8.3, 10/20/2017): Very good but so fucked up. Acting was great, Screenplay was excellent, Story was excellent, Incredible Score, way to grotesque, jump cuts created a genre.",2000,01/11/2022,50,tt0180093

The Notebook,5.1,"Bad direction, Pretty good story, very bad screenplay, Acting was pretty bad overall (Only the elder characters were decent while everyone else was very bad), Pretty Bad score, Zero chemistry between the two leads which shows how there is barely any emotion from the flashback scenes, elderly couple shows decent chemistry and emotion which is a saving grace for the film (But like barely), the movie lays out as if there is going to be a twist but then spoils it midway through the movie which makes it very wasted, decent pacing, Movie was probably made by an angsty teen who wanted to get into NYU film school couldn't.",2004,08/07/2020,152,tt0332280

Nightcrawler,9.2,"Great to Incredible direction, Great to Incredible Screenplay (Writing for Jake was incredible (Both in character writing and how they made his character's dialogue be from the perspective of someone who reads info from online), but other aspects of the writing were not on the same level), Incredible Story, Brilliant Acting from Jake Gyllenhaal (Best performance to not get nominated for Best Actor), Very good acting by two other leads, good acting by supporting cast, Pacing was incredible towards the beginning and end but the middle hour of the movie was bit slow at times, Incredible character writing for Lou Bloom, Great to incredible Cinematography and lighting, Pretty good to good Score, Good build of suspense (a very high intensity film as well) to the climax but kinda tapers off with the final dialogue between Riz Ahmed and Jake (Would have liked to just see it end with the opening line). Overall, a movie that is incredible from the perspective of Lou as he drives the film forward but is only great from that perspective as he is the glue for all the pieces coming together.",2014,08/12/2020,154,tt2872718

Overall, what makes the movie is the acting by the cast, the action/intense scenes, and screenplay, but what makes the movie not great is the unorganized story arc and extremely fast pacing.",2010,08/18/2020,156,tt0840361

Groundhog Day,8.6,"Funny to Very Funny movie (Especially Bill Murray), Iconic story, good screenplay, Movie is kinda about nothing but thats pretty much the point, the character development is shown but its kinda rushed towards the end against doing it throughout the movie, Good acting by the cast (very good by murray).

The Terminator,7.1,"Acting on a spectrum (Arnold Schwarzenegger was good, Linda Hamilton was pretty good, Michael Biehn and some of the cops were decent but over-the-top at times, extras were very bad), Very Good/Iconic Story, Iconic lines (Which were perfected in the sequel) but very bad screenplay overall as the dialogue was very stiff/forced/not natural, Pretty good score (Sequel perfected the themes) as it gave a very 80s/retro futuristic feel and builds tension with the consent loud beating, Very Poor production design/visual effects when displaying the future, good makeup (Very good for Arnold), cinematography was pretty bad (Good for some scenes but very bad in others), action sequences were choreographed very well), Direction was on the spectrum (Good during moments of action and crisis but poor when directing other plot moments), good sound mixing, good pacing average (very good in terms of plot development but can be rushed or drag at times), climax was good in terms of action and suspense, The movie has a decent budget but looks like a student film at times. Overall, the movie is decent in terms of a watch but as a movie overall lacks in a lot of areas, but these areas are definitely improved upon and made better with the sequel as the budget/experience to make a better movie was there.",1984,08/30/2020,161,tt0088247

Overall, a great exposition story for the origins of bond and set up a great bond portrayal by the best bond, Daniel Craig.",2006,09/09/2020,162,tt0381061
Monty Python's Life of Brian,7.9,"Pretty Funny Movie (Some of the jokes were well thought out but some of them were pretty cheap imo but were still funny), Decent story and satire on Christianity and socialism, Funny acting by some of the characters, A movie that uses its short runtime very well as pacing is very good. Overall, a film that uses its R rating to have a lot of boundary pushing comedy, but one where the jokes are kinda cheap (Not a outright recommendation but still enjoyed watching it).",1979,09/09/2020,163,tt0079470
Tenet,8.6,"Good Direction (Incredible during action scenes and coordinating stunts and introducing scenes but poor during moments of conducting dialogue and the more personal scenes), decent acting (Very good from Robert Pattinson, Pretty good from John David Washington (Very emotionless in the first half though), Kenneth Branagh was pretty good to good but over-the-top at times, and the rest of the cast was bad to pretty bad), Great to Incredible Story and Idea (Though I think the middle chunk of the movie was kinda a waste, and the ideas were not executed that well), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was very stiff and not well executed to show what the ideas of the movie were), Great Cinematography, Incredible Score, Great to Incredible Effects, Bad Sound Mixing but Great Sound editing, Incredible Film Editing to coordinate backwards and forwards movement, The movie is very confusing in the first half but make more sense and come full circle once the halfway point is met, All the action scenes are incredible intense and pulled off very well in terms of the suspense they create (Especially the first scene and the climax), A movie that makes more sense the more you think about it, The pacing was way too fast and this played a major issue in presenting ideas and having dialogue cause it made things very unnatural and made things very confusing, A lot of the concepts on time did not make any sense and time travel is just a subject in film to stay away from overall (Even if you are Christopher Nolan). Overall, this was Christopher Nolan's worst movie (Hard for me to say it as it is) given the fact he is a seasoned director at this point and could not execute a movie of this magnitude off, but it is still a Good movie and would still recommend people to watch.",2020,09/15/2020,164,tt6723592
Cuties,1.9,"Poor Direction, Very boring screenplay (From a translation perspective), the story had a decent idea but the plot points were very wtf and ultimately not necessary, very poor acting (Especially for the controversial scenes), The lack of score makes the movie extremely emotionless and the scenes seem very dull, The movie isn't as controversial as people are saying it is although the final 30 mins definitely could be argued against this because it was very cringe/hard to watch, It tries to show the evil in child sexualization but does it so poorly that it ultimately promotes it. Very bad movie overall and very boring to watch.",2020,09/28/2020,165,tt9196192
Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,8.0,"Continuation of a beloved classic and one of, if not the, greatest comedies of all time. In its sequel, Borat does not have as much of the charm as its original movie did. Very funny at times but very mild or bland or disgusting at others, story was coherent as very politically brown nose against the right, the movie is ultimately propaganda to vote. Sacha Baron Cohen was great, though lost a step from her previous version, Maria Bakalova was good acting but was no where near the level of sidekick as Azamt, Good but safe story, Very good but safe screenplay, Good direction (But misleading editing). Overall, This movie was a good look back into one of the greatest movies of all time but plays it safe and ultimately boils down into a movie urging the audience to vote out the right (making it a very topical movie at the present but something that will not make it a classic like its predecessor). This movie really didn't have to be made and looks like a cash grab on a retired character.",2020,10/29/2020,166,tt13143964
The Social Dilemma,7.3,"Great Topics that are complex but presented in a very simple manner that makes it easy to digest, Expert testimony of the documentary is very good as it brings in a lot of industry experience and credibility to persuade the audience to change how they view social media and technology, I felt they brushed on topics they should've discussed more (Like mental health), the skits were very poorly written and acted and they really drew away from the message of the documentary as they were very unrealistic, the message of the documentary was a little too pessimistic of what may actually happen. Overall, thought the ideas were very well presented, the skits and ending message really hold this documentary back from making a strong impact on the relationship between social media and society.",2020,11/22/2020,167,tt11464826
Fargo,8.6,"Very Good Direction, Good Acting (Great from Frances McDormand, Very Good from William H. Macy, Good to Very Good from Steve Buscemi, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Good from the remaining main cast, and decent from the supporting cast and extras)), Great Story (though is very surface level in its imagery and symbolism), Great Screenplay (laced with witty, quirky midwestern dialogue (as seen by the intentional awkward pauses during the Minnesotan conversations)), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Especially the distant panning shots that show the contrast between the main images and the snow), Pacing is Great for the most part given its short runtime (but is incredibly rushed towards the end (particularly the final 15-20 minutes)). Overall, the Coen brothers give a prime example of why they are some of the best screenwriters in Hollywood as they make a short runtime filled with many memorable, funny moments (even though it may not be as incredible as their other movies), but it does falter towards the end as it is incredibly rushed as it feels like it could've used 15 more minutes to keep up to the pace it had for the majority of the movie.",1996,11/22/2020,168,tt0116282
A Clockwork Orange,9.2,"Very Good to Great Direction, Very Good Acting (Great Acting from Malcolm McDowell, Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (Very true to the source material), Great Screenplay (Very hard to understand and watch at first as it is very Shakespearean due to the fictional Nadsat language they use, but once you overcome the first 30 mins, the screenplay gradually increases to where it is incredible towards the end), Great Score/Soundtrack (Especially with the use of classical music along with its iconic original score), Incredible Cinematography (Very Kubrick in style), Incredible Production Design, Pacing is great ( broken up into 3 distinct parts (like the book) that gradually increases towards the climax), climax is very intense and keeps the audience in their seat. Overall, a movie that is very hard to watch in the first 1/3 (both because of imagery, understanding the dialogue, plot, and pace), but once you get past that point, it is an great to incredible piece of art that shows the line between psychological treatment and free will as well as the ability for the redemption of the lost.",1971,11/27/2020,169,tt0066921
Boyz n the Hood,8.5,"Good to Very Good Direction, Good Acting (The cast overall works well with each other (especially the main cast)), Great Story (Emotional and makes you feel for the character's struggles), Very Good Screenplay, Pretty Good Score (Gives it a very 80s Law and Order SVU vibes), Good Pacing (Keeps a constant steady pace).

Full Metal Jacket,8.6,"Great Direction, Good Acting (Good from Matthew Modine, Good from Vincent D'Onofrio, Very Good from Lee Ermey, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Most were pretty good but some were mediocre)), Good to Very Good Story (Very good in the boot camp (first 40%) and Good during the Vietnam War parts), Great Screenplay (Deviates from the source material but is still very whitty and bends the line between comical and serious very well), Cinematography (Very Kubrick in style but still is a bit different as it still has similar tones to traditional war movies), Pacing was generally very slow but consistent to Kubrick style pacing, The build to the climax is not that well done as there are many jumps in the narrative and the resolution does not really exist, Very well choreography war scenes. Overall, a good movie that shows the horrors of war and the effects it has on soldiers, but is very shallow in its meaning and message when compared to Kubrick's other films.",1987,12/23/2020,171,tt0093058

Simmons, Good from the rest of the cast), Brilliant Story, Brilliant Screenplay, Incredible Score, Great Cinematography (Brilliant use of lighting to establish mood and themes), Incredible Editing, Pacing is Great to Incredible as it gives it a very artsy feel that slowly builds to a brilliant climax, climax is brilliant as it is filled with symbolism till the very last shot as JKs mouth is covered showing his recognition is all that Andrew needed to think he is one of the greats. Overall, one of, if not the best, movies to show the obsession of an artist that wants to make it to the top, stopping at nothing to get there, as they are pushed past their mental breaking point to achieve their goal.",2014,12/24/2020,172,tt2582802
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,8.0,"Pretty Good Direction, Pretty Good Acting (A surprisingly studded all star cast where each actor plays their role very well, but there are issues (Cohen's accent was very annoying and characters, like Amy Adams, were overacting at times)), Very Good Screenplay (Very funny movie (Stupid funny but funny); Most jokes hit but when they miss its pretty eh; very Will Ferrell in its joke telling in that he breaks the pace or adds on to a joke to make it funnier (This either hits or can be annoying at times)), Pretty Good Sound Editing/Mixing, Pretty Good Editing, Pacing was intentionally fast (which leaves no room for development), the build to the climax really is ok but definitely could've been better. Overall, a fun movie to watch for leisure that has many jokes that hit very well and are very quotable, even though it may be stupid funny.",2006,12/26/2020,173,tt0415306
Elf,8.5,"Very Good Direction (Especially for the lengths Jon Favreau went to limit the use of CGI), Good Acting (Very Good from Will Ferrell, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone plays their part well)), Very Good/Iconic Story (Although it is filled with cliches and is very safe), Very Good Screenplay, Great Cinematography (Uses force perspective very well (even though it can lead to inconsistencies at times)), Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Especially for the stop motion parts of the film to give is a very classic Christmas movie feel), Pacing was pretty good overall, Build to climax is pretty abrupt but the overall ending is pretty intense for a Christmas movie and Favreau pulls it off very well. Overall, an iconic christmas movie that is filled with many emotions, makes you root for the characters, and makes you remember the spirit of christmas, even though the movie is very safe, formulaic, cliche, and plays its cards very close to its chest (something I can't really blame given its a family Christmas movie).",2003,12/26/2020,174,tt0319343
A Christmas Story,7.3,"Pretty Good Direction, Pretty Good Acting (from the entire cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (Pretty funny but is extremely slow in its pacing and is longer than it needs to be), Decent Screenplay (With ""You'll shoot your eye out kid"" being an iconic quote in all of cinema), Plot Structure is on the spectrum as the build to the climax is throughout the whole movie and pulls it off decently well but the movie needed to end after the last use of the ""iconic line"" because all the scenes after that are pretty pointless and make the movie feel like its dragging more than it should, Pacing is very slow as the movie seems incredibly long despite the fact that it is surprisingly only a little over an hour and a half, Narration made the story a lot slower than it needed to be and kinda dragged away from what was being told. Overall, a movie that is kinda overrated, has not aged that well compared to other christmas movies, and has incredible pacing and length issues, but is still an entertaining watch for the family during Christmas time..",1983,12/26/2020,175,tt0085334
Soul,9.2,"Great Direction, Good Voice Acting (From the cast as a whole (with Tina Fay being a standout)), Great Story (Though pretty predictable, especially the ending), Great Screenplay, Very Good Score, Incredible Animation (The best animation from Pixar by far), Pacing was Decent, Build to climax is good and the climax was very well done, the themes and concepts were very thought provoking and were very well executed (especially for a kids movie).

Overall, the best Pixar movie (a little biased) that shows the loving dynamic of a father-daughter relationship through an animation filled adventure; lives up to how much I loved it as a kid and more, especially Mike Wazowski.",2001,01/09/2021,177,tt0198781
The Departed,9.4,"Incredible Direction, Incredible Acting (From the cast as a whole (Standouts being Leonardo DiCaprio (in his 2nd best role behind Wolf), Mark Walburg, and Jack Nicholson (Even though its pretty over-the-top))), Incredible Story (Filled with symbols of the dark nature of the subject manner (the quest of the rat)), Incredible Screenplay (Mixes humor and trauma extremely effectively), Decent Cinematography (Not a huge fan of the still cuts edited with the shifting cinematography), Decent Editing (See cinematography), Plot Structure was good for the most part (but the beginning was a bit hard to understand (but can get past this after the first 20-30 mins)), Pacing was generally good but there are some slower parts meant for character development (not a huge problem); The movie was a bit on the longer side but there really isn't that many scenes that could be cut (so it gets a pass), Build to the climax is incredible with the ending being extremely suspenseful and unpredictable. Overall, a movie that is a must watch, even with its small faults, as it uses Boston wit and humor laced into a story and screenplay to show the effects trauma and crime can have on people stuck in the rat race as the push through through what is ethical, in what is a Martin Scorsese masterpiece.",2006,01/14/2021,178,tt0407887
First Blood,8.5,"Good Direction, Pretty Good Acting (Great from Sylvester Stallone (though I'm biased), Pretty Good from Richard Crenna, Decent from the rest of the cast), Very Good Story (Actually handles PTSD from Vietnam pretty well), Minimal Screenplay (Works to show how traumatized Rambo is), Pretty Bad Sound Editing/Mixing (A bit off (but thats the 80s for yah)), Pacing is very fast as it is fueled by its action (with a very short runtime that would have definitely benefited from 15-20 minutes of character building or exposition), Build to the climax was pretty good with the overall climax executed very well as we see all the sides of Rambo, Action is what keeps the movie going as Rambo constantly builds up his arsenal with the more kills he gets (but it is important to note that many of the actions that Rambo did were extremely unnecessary and escalated the situation a lot more than it needed to be. Overall, a movie that is a fun action movie to watch as Sly gives off one of his iconic performances to create a signature character that is a war machine suffering from PTSD that is trying his best to just to live in a post-Vietnam, anti-war society.",1982,01/14/2021,179,tt0083944
Reservoir Dogs,8.6,"Good Direction, Good Acting (By the whole cast (With Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel standing out the most)), Good Story, Great Screenplay (very Tarantino-esque), Pretty Good Editing (Tarantino-esque), Plot Structure is very minimal as the audience is thrown right at the end and they have to put pieces together throughout, Pacing was all over the place given the way the narrative was told (No fault really); very short runtime (which is fine because there is very little plot), There really isn't any climax to build too (No fault given that you start at the very end), The feel and style of the movie has a very similar feel to Usual Suspects (But I liked this one more), A lot of mistakes and misses which shows in Tarantino's first film (Definitely can see his growth throughout his career). Overall, a ""Usual Suspects"" type film that is a good watch with good moments as the audience gets to see a sloppy, amateur filmmaker that is looking to make a name for himself (in what became a great launching point for one of the best filmmakers ever).",1992,01/19/2021,180,tt0105236

Overall, a movie that is extremely metaphorical in nature about the world moving towards an evil that the old cannot adapt to that is filled with Iconic Dialogue, Great Action moments, and Incredible performances that make the movie a must watch that is incredibly true to the source material, even the though the pace is very slow and the tone is very dull.",2007,01/19/2021,181,tt0477348

Overall, a decent movie that shows moments of greatness from a future star (Bale and somewhat Leto) as the movie has good moments to watch (like the killing scenes and the overanalyzing from Bateman), but there are a lot of flaws in the movie that make it very hard to watch at times when looking at the greed of wall street from a very surface level, pretentious lense..",2000,01/24/2021,182,tt0144084
The Royal Tenenbaums,8.1,"Good Direction, Good Acting (The cast overall was good (but individual performances were pretty good to decent from how bland they can be)), Good Story, Good Screenplay (but quirky), Good Cinematography (Was Wes Anderson to a Tee from the amount of shots/angle changes), Good Editing, There really was no real plot to movie but themes of overcoming a toxic family dynamic was shown very well. Overall, a pretty good watch that shows how broken pieces of a family can still come together to make a single unit through adversity in what is a prime example of Wes Anderson filmmaking with its quirks and cinematography.",2001,01/24/2021,183,tt0265666
Demon Slayer: Mugen Train,8.4,"Good Direction, Good to Very Good Story, Very anime-esque Screenplay (But did have very emotional points that were carried out very well), Good Score, Incredible Animation/Action Sequences, Pacing was very off considering first half was story and the second half was just an entire fight sequence, The build-up to the end was great but the ending was very anticlimactic/poorly done.

Overall, for a movie with such a low budget, the creators were able to develop the most from what they could as they created an iconic story line that is a mainstay in the horror franchise, even though it may not be the best in its presentation..",2004,05/11/2021,187,tt0387564

Overall, even though the movie does falter a lot in the development of its plot and pacing, The Exorcist is a groundbreaking movie in the horror genre (With its direction, screenplay, and acting) and stands up to be one of the most iconic movies not only in its genre but all time..",1973,05/13/2021,188,tt0070047

Overall, a movie that is pretty overrated as the movie is basically just shots of Japan that is mixed with good dialogue and scenes between Bill Murray and Scarjo, but in the end falters from its lack of story and very dull presentation (as it fails to capture to true aspects of loneliness).",2003,05/24/2021,189,tt0335266

Overall, a great film that is one of the most entertaining films to watch as it is a thrill of a ride to see all the different scams Frank Abagnale was able to pull off from the very start to the very end, something that really keeps you engaged at all times.",2002,05/24/2021,190,tt0264464

Overall, a film that is very visually pleasing (an artsy movie that actually pulls it off very nicely) and well made that makes society question AI and how cognizant we should make Automata (definitely one of the better portrayals of this phenomenon), even if the film blows it more out of proportion/exaggerates the extent/ideas behind it.",2014,05/30/2021,195,tt0470752

Overall, a pretty good movie (especially for horror) that has a lot of bright moments (like Haley Joel Osment) that put me on the edge of my seat and make the movie a horror classic (putting M.Night on the map), even though it falters a lot in terms of the plot holes and lackluster moments.",1999,05/30/2021,196,tt0167404

Overall, an incredibly beautiful story on the effects prison has on men (especially innocent men) as they have to come to terms with their lives as they are stripped away from their freedom and have to continue to find hope even though the system keeps on trying to strip it away from them (something that makes you care for the subjects and makes you cheer and cry for them); moreover, the film is 1/3 of the trio of 1994 that is the embodiment of cinema before that year (given by the story telling and feel of the movie being from the 50s-60s).",1994,06/05/2021,198,tt0111161

Overall, and Incredible Movie that stands up to being 'One of the best movies ever made' as it is the definition of subtly and symbolism (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions) in a movie as Coppola delivers a magnum opus not only in his career but for the whole film industry (something that others have tried to learn from).",1972,06/10/2021,199,tt0068646

Overall, a Great to Incredible Movie that stands up to being 'One of the best sequels ever made' as it is another definition of symbolism and visual queues (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions, especially Michael's eyes looking into characters) in a movie as Coppola offers a continuation of a story rather than a sequel.",1974,06/11/2021,200,tt0071562

Overall, a bad movie that is a clear cash grab by using the Godfather name as it is a simple/dull movie that is horribly cut and contains many amateur elements, and while a third movie did need to be made it was clear that it was too late as the way this movie was presented makes it so distant from the previous two (making the audience start to see the downfall in Francis Ford Coppola's abilities).",1990,06/11/2021,201,tt0099674

Overall, a great movie that is both a simple, yet complex modern retelling of Swan Lake that looks into the obsession of an artist and how far one will go to pollute their innocence to become the best, even though it was told in a very simple, direct way.",2010,06/21/2021,202,tt0947798

Overall, a movie with brilliant moments and brilliant aspects that is dragged down by its extremely long runtime and slow pace; despite all of this, the movie was great as it explores the relationship between family and profession against the backdrop of a space exploration epic in one of Nolan's finest moments (even though he may falter at times).",2014,07/05/2021,207,tt0816692

Overall, a Pretty Good to Good movie that was very entertaining to watch the narrator devolve from a consumer lifestyle to a point where he loses himself in a modern day retelling of 'Catcher in the Rye' (Which is kinda a reason for why I did not like parts of the movie cause it was extremely annoying).",1999,07/19/2021,210,tt0137523

The Wrestler,9.3,"Great Direction, Pretty Good Acting (Incredible from Mickey Rourke, Very Good to Great from Marisa Tomei, Decent to Pretty Good from Evan Rachel Wood (Some moments were good and some moments were pretty bad), Decent from the rest of the cast (anywhere from pretty bad to pretty good)), Great Story (the plot develops into seeing how being past his prime has an effect on the Ram as he tries to escape loneliness), Very Good to Great Screenplay (With some moments being Incredible with the dialogue and symbolism and some moments being pretty iffy), Score use was subtle, Cinematography on a spectrum (nauseating a lot of the times, but the single camera action does help show the loneliness of the Ram), Great Editing (Used well to show how the Ram still views/hold onto his life as a wrestler even though he is well past his prime (best scene to show this was his walkup to working his first shift at the deli)), Pacing was good towards the ends of the movie but the third act out of 4 felt really slow and dragging at times; runtime was good (no need to add/cut scenes,maybe in that third act), The build to the climax was a full 180 and very sudden (not executed very well overall) but the actual climax of the movie was its best moment (climax/ending of the movie was incredible and extremely well done as you see how the Ram comes to terms with the choices he has made and the path he sets for himself (especially on how he views his relationships with his lover and his daughter/ his relationship with the fans), The character of the Ram was very well written as a lost soul who clings onto the highs of his life but instead dives deeper into the loneliness of humanity; very accurate representation of wrestling and wrestling technique. Overall, a Great to Incredible movie that shows the loneliness of clinging to the past and the eventual hole you can never get out of as we view the life of the Ram trying to come to terms with his life despite the best parts of his wrestling career being behind him (though the third act out of 4 was not as well executed as I would have liked it to be).",2008,07/24/2021,212,tt1125849
Leaving Las Vegas,4.9,"Decent Direction, Pretty Bad Acting (Very Good to Great from Nicolas Cage (In a Nic Cage Way; the most Nic Cage performance I have ever seen), Good from Elisabeth Shue (Dull in terms of execution of dialogue but very good in terms of actions and gestures), Bad from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (I like the way it flows and how the story is told from the perspective of the end), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was very poorly written but the actual actions the characters take were good; no major symbolism), Score/Songs were very Vegas-esque with this jazzy sound and not necessarily bad but were just way extremely overbearing in the film and took away from the story, Decent Cinematography (especially for it being super low budge), Terrible Sound (I did not like how overbearing the score/music was in the story and how it made it incredibly hard to hear the dialogue at times), Good Editing (I liked some of the metaphors it placed with the different cuts), Pacing was very bad and incredibly slow (the first 10-20 minutes of the movie were meant to be the prologue but was just way to long and slow in terms of developing the story and characters); the runtime was at just under 2 hours but definitely could have cut the movie by like 30 minutes to make the movie have a better pace and remove a lot of unnecessary scenes, The build to the climax was like not really there but kinda there (not executed that well overall), The relationship that the two leads have is decent and not bad but like its too formulaic and safe; Nic Cage's character is a decent character but was just way too Nic Cage in terms of its mannerisms and acting (you will know when you see it) but the portrayal of an suicidal alcoholic was not that bad; the movie was completely formulaic overall (Scene of dialogue and action -> Overbearing Jazz score that pans to the either Vegas of the characters -> Songs with the same panning -> Fades to black to the next sequence). Overall, a bad movie as its only saving grace is to see the performance that won Nic Cage an Oscar (In the most Nic Cage way he could do it) and nothing else because the entire movie would have been awful if it was not for him as this low budget film really could not have been saved by the material (which was not that great to begin with).",1995,07/25/2021,213,tt0113627
Space Jam,7.2,"Pretty Bad Direction, Bad Acting (Decent from Michael Jordan, Pretty Good to Good from Wayne Knight, Great from Danny DeVito, Very Bad from the rest of the live acting cast; Great Voice Acting by the entire Looney Tunes cast), Good Story, Screenplay of two halves (Looney Tunes Parts were great and very similar to its traditional style, Real life parts were bad to pretty bad overall; there were some good references and jokes that I did appreciate (Mighty Ducks, Pulp Fiction, Patton, etc.)), Decent to Pretty Good Score (Liked how it incorporated Looney Tunes elements); Good Soundtrack, Pretty Good Cinematography (made it feel very animated), Decent Sound, Decent Editing, Pretty Good Animation and stitches with real life (especially for the time) as it gives it a pretty cartoony feel, Pacing was very fast and really rushed between plot elements; Runtime was very short (definitely could have used 15-20 minutes in the rising action as the film goes from exposition to the climax), Skips build to climax; the actual basketball game (climax) was executed very well as it was the best part of the movie and gives off a good message to the audience, The movie is pretty surface level but the majority of it is geared towards kids and people who wanted to see MJ so i give it a pass. Overall, a decent, fun watch that was geared mostly for kids as it was good to see how two icons (MJ in the NBA and Bugs Bunny in Looney Tunes) were able to come together to give off a lot of iconic moments with the battle with the monstars as the movie does not try to take itself too seriously.",1996,07/28/2021,214,tt0117705
Slumdog Millionaire,9.4,"Incredible to Brilliant Direction, Very Good Acting (Great from Dev Patel, Good from Freida Pinto, Great from Anil Kapoor, Great from Irrfan Khan, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Great from Kids, Good from adults, Decent from teenagers)), Incredible Story (A mix of bollywood with hollywood in a telling of 'Indian' Forrest Gump; also, the narrative and the story points molding together was extremely well done), Great to Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue during the non-romantic parts were incredible while the romantic parts were not as well done; the symbolism of how Jamal was able to use life experiences to be a true rags to riches was incredible), Great Score/Incredible Soundtrack, Great Cinematography, Good Sound, Incredible Editing, Great Production Design (shows the poorer parts of india (rest was also good)), Pacing was good but a bit inconsistent (slow during the childhood, extremely fast during the teenage years, decently fast during the adult years); runtime was a bit long but not terrible (probably could have cut out a few sequences), The build to the climax was incredible with the actual climax being extremely tense and modeling how bollywood climaxes are usually; the resolution was a bit poor in its execution and the movie could have ended with the climax (though the bollywood sequence at the end was a nice touch), The incredible nature of the movie is how the plot points throughout the movie connect at the end and during the competition (even though there aren't any deeper meanings in the movie); it is important to note that many of the elements of the movie is incredibly unlikely to happen (like people from the slums learning fluent English). Overall, a Great to Incredible Movie that shows some of the dangerous and true natures of India while highlighting some of its beauty as Danny Boyle pulls off an incredible rendition of 'Indian Forrest Gump' by loosely basing a story from the source material to show a bollywood rendition of the 'rags to riches' trope in what is an incredible watch.",2008,08/01/2021,215,tt1010048
Magnolia,7.9,"Very Good Direction, Very Good Acting (Incredible from Tom Cruise (Though he was literally just playing himself), Good to Very Good from Philip Baker Hall, Very Good to Great from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Great from William H. Macy, Very Good to Great from Julianne Moore, Good to Very Good from John C. Reilly, Decent from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (I liked the way the store points ran parallel in narrative but intersected at many points throughout the movie; though, it does falter in the last 20-30 minutes), Good Screenplay (There is a lot of symbolism throughout the movie which I really enjoyed but the dialogue was just very basic, unnatural, and hard to watch), Good Score, Great Cinematography, Decent to Pretty Good Sound, Great Editing, The runtime of the movie is extremely long even with the 8 different stories (2-3 of the stories should have been cut to make a more polished product); the ending of the movie was very poor as it had to pick up the pieces from its very weird climax and only tied up the loose ends for like half of the stories (leaving the other half unfinished and questioning), Pacing was extremely slow (Especially dragging at some points) in the first half of the movie and extremely fast in the second half), The build to the climax was great and executed very nicely but the actual climax was a 180 from what it was building to and completely threw off the flow and experience of the movie (like I get why PTA did it but it still was just very poorly executed and threw off the movie for no reason), The conveying of tramua and emotions was pretty good and well executed as many of the characters are guilted and haunted by their pasts but at times it felt like the acting was a bit over the top (this also ties in with the use of the symbols as it explains these moments of trauma very well). Overall, a Pretty Good movie that has a lot of great moments and shows how the different characters lives intersect as they deal with their past trauma, but it falters from its inconsistent pace, terrible use of runtime (Given that it is extremely long and still does not manage to tie up loose ends), and very questionable ending (Something I see a lot from PTA).",1999,08/09/2021,216,tt0175880
Ferris Bueller's Day Off,8.0,"Good Direction, Pretty Good to Good Acting (Very Good from Matthew Broderick, Good from Alan Ruck, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (Pretty simplistic in its nature but contains very iconic scenes), Pretty Good Screenplay (Iconic Lines and Scenes throughout the movie with its breaking the fourth wall but the overall screenplay was pretty simple and bland (reeks of the 80s); little to no noticable symbolism), Very Good/Iconic Soundtrack, Pretty Good Cinematography, Good Film Editing, Pacing was a valley (very fast towards the beginning and ends but pretty slow in the middle); the runtime was on the shorter side but 20 minutes in the middle definitely could have been cut to produce the same movie, The build to the climax was a short spike that is very fast with the actual climax being an iconic sequence where Ferris tries to get back home; the ending of the movie was decent with everything coming back full circle (With the post credits being very funny and iconic, something groundbreaking for its day), The movie is kinda dry throughout but it is more of a film that is meant to watch and enjoy rather than dissect (though a lot of people give this movie more credit than it deserves). Overall, a Pretty Good movie that contains a lot of iconic moments and is a fun watch as we see the protagonist try to live some of his last moments of youth before growing up, but the movie is still pretty shallow with its content as it reeks of the 80s (especially with its subjects and meta storytelling).",1986,08/16/2021,217,tt0091042
Field of Dreams,7.8,"Pretty Good to Good Direction, Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good to Good from Kevin Costner (Kinda has the same expression throughout the movie (not bad but very static)), Good to Very Good from Amy Madigan, Good to Very Good from James Earl Jones, Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (Though a majority of the movie stems away from the actual subject of the film as the film takes about 40 minutes into a pointless side quest), Pretty Good Screenplay (Has iconic lines and good moments but the rest of the dialogue reeks of the 80s and is kinda bland), Great Score, Pretty Good Cinematography, Good Film Editing, Pacing was extremely fast in the beginning then pretty good in the middle and then pretty slow towards the end with a very abrupt ending (though the ending of the movie was decent to pretty good with everything coming back full circle (As all the points come to the purpose of Kevin Costner's character)), The build to the climax was very abrupt as you realize you missed the climax right as it is about to end; the runtime was on the shorter side but was very poorly used as there definitely could've been 10-20 minutes added towards the climax/resolution, The symbolism and themes throughout the movie are very romantic/hopeful as it makes you believe in a heavenly body experience as you romanticize about baseball. Overall, a Decent to Pretty Good movie that makes you root for the characters and gets very emotional at times as you go through a baseball themed adventure but is very overrated as the film does not use its runtime effectively and stems away from the subject/purpose of the movie.",1989,08/16/2021,218,tt0097351
The Suicide Squad,8.7,"Very Good Direction, Very Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Margot Robbie, Very Good to Great from Idris Elba, Very Good from Joel Kinnaman, Very Good to Great from Sylvester Stallone (Voice Acting, a little biased though), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good to Good Story (though a bit formulaic by combining pieces from the original movie and Guardians of the Galaxy; also, while I liked that there were misdirections/twists, I felt there were a bit too many by the end), Very Good to Great Screenplay (Very Tarantino-Esque as it is serious but is filled with great comedic dialogue to break tension; really liked how they used CGI/effects as a part of the storytelling), Decent Score/Good Soundtrack (Though the mix with old and new songs kinda clashed at times for me), Good Cinematography, Incredible Editing, Incredible Visual Effects (really liked how they used CGI as a part of the storytelling; liked the visual gore style cause it showed a blend of both cartoony yet realistic), Great Production Design, Pacing was good to very good (a bit quick at the end but nothing terrible), Build to the climax was very good with the overall climax being very well executed (bit long though); runtime was ok but 10-15 minutes of the movie could have been cut (especially at the end), the major flaws of the movie were that it was extremely formulaic as the storytelling was basically a carbon-copy of Guardians of the Galaxy (with it having a comedic relief character non-human who speaks few words and a ex-pro wrestler being the tough guy) with the story of the original Suicide Squad and the gore of Invincible. Overall, a very fun watch that makes me have confidence in the direction DC is going with their movies as this film has creative story telling, great characters, and great action sequences, even though it was very formulaic and a very similar/close-copy to Guardians of the Galaxy (which makes sense given its from James Gunn).",2021,08/24/2021,219,tt6334354
Sideways,9.1,"Great Direction, Great Acting (Incredible to Brilliant from Paul Giamatti (especially how he was able to embody someone with extreme anxiety and depression; Paul Giamatti is the focal point while all the others were great supporting elements to aspects of his character), Great from Thomas Haden Church (though it started out a bit rough), Very Good to Great from Virginia Madsen, Very Good from Sandra Oh, ), Great Story (A bit rough at first as the plot as the first 1/4, exposition of the movie was very dry in its details but the plot/story really begins to hit its stride and start running afterwards), Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue was both very conversational and elegant at times as it does a great job knowing when to shift from conversations to monologues throughout the movie (incorporating both the scholarly personality of Giamatti's character and the 'valley dude, player' in Haden Church's character)), Pretty Good Score, Decent Cinematography, Good to Very Good Editing, Pacing was a bit on the slower side throughout the whole movie (with the first 1/4 being extremely slow and the final 3/4 being a bit slow); Runtime was decent but could have been a bit more optimal if 10-15 minutes was cut from the beginning of the movie, There really was no build to the climax but the ending was very well done as Giamatti's character really comes to terms with who is and what he wants, the portrayals of mental health concepts (anxiety, loneliness, depression) are very well done as Paul Giamatti does an excellent job in portraying someone who struggles with these concepts as he tries to try one final push at life. Overall, a great movie that starts off very rough (a true slow burn), but it is an excellent portrayal of finding one's self as they deal with personal struggles as we get a snapshot of a friendship exploring wine country looking for love, something that could have really been polished if the exposition was a bit tighter (making the movie possibly a 9.4-9.5).",2004,08/27/2021,220,tt0375063

Overall, a fun, iconic horror movie that made the most that it could from its very low budget by creating iconic moments and characters, even though it suffers from a poorly constructed plot structure that spends the first hour in dragging, exposition moments.",1978,10/21/2021,221,tt0077651

Overall, a movie with great visuals and the presentations of a great space epic that acts as more of a prologue and beginning of a story than a full movie, though it does suffer from bad storytelling that makes the movie hard to follow; hopefully, this means that this part one sets up part two to be a better movie.",2021,10/31/2021,223,tt1160419

Overall, a classic in the horror genre that lives up to the name as many iconic elements of the movie make Psycho a must watch for the slasher genre (especially considering how ahead of its time it was), even though it does have a good amount of filler elements.",1960,11/08/2021,224,tt0054215

Overall, a good watch to show the importance influence can have on corrupting the mind as we go through the story of Derek Vinyard (through an incredible and powerful performance from Edward Norton) to see how America is a nation filled with flaws and it is up to us to learn from and overcome these flaws (even though some may not be ready to do so), even though the movie may be meta and simple and representation in this message.",1998,11/09/2021,225,tt0120586

Overall, an incredible movie that is one of the most fun watches anyone can ever have as the audience goes through the incredible adventure of Forrest Gump's life to see how much someone can do despite having so little (A true testament of the importance love and heart can have as a driving factor).",1994,11/22/2021,228,tt0109830
Goodfellas,9.3,"Incredible Direction (With the ability to handle such fast paced moments with a lot of moving parts at once and the conversations between characters), Great Acting (Very Good to Great from Robert Di Nero (though his character really does not have that much of a presence in relation to his billing for the movie), Great from Ray Liotta (was the right person to drive the story forward, just was not that amazing in the very emotional and sad parts), Incredible from Joe Pesci (in a very Joe Pesci way), Very Good to Great from Lorraine Bracco (though the interjections in narration from her character were not that great), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast (which is telling considering the number of characters in this movie)), Incredible Story (With Ray Liota's narration being an iconic feature for the movie in depicting the life of Henry Hill, though the final parts of the plot did drag on a bit), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (with the language being so fluid yet vulgar, the actions conveying the tone of the film, and the film being filled with iconic moments and lines), Incredible Cinematography (helped with setting the tone and keeping the pace going), Good Sound, Great to Incredible Editing, Plot Structure was good (though more time was spent in the first half introducing elements, the climax and the resolution dragged for a bit; the first half of the plot had a lot of elements displayed very fast while the second half had less elements and took longer that expected to explain them); I feel that the exposition and rising action were the real key points of the movie as that was what the most time was spent on and really shows the development of the characters, Pacing was very quick except towards the end (where the final 40 minutes really dragged on, and it probably could have been cut in half (still felt it dragged even though it was quick)), In my eyes there were 2 real climaxes for the movie (the build to the first one was great as they really laid out the suspense of its nature, the second climax (while not as big) was not developed that well); did not really like the ending because I felt it was very abrupt, Tone and mood of the movie is carried out so well by Martin Scorsese as this movie is a prime example of why this formula/movie genre works so well from him (in what might be his prime example for mob movies), Pretty Good score (despite not officially having one); Good soundtrack (helped set the tone of the movie); the key points of the movie that make it one of the most famous crime/mob movies is the characters that carry out incredible dialogue as it keeps the audience really hooked and care for the main three characters. Overall, a Great movie that is incredible for the first 3/4 as you get to see Martin Scorsese work in his natural element to create one of the mob movies that defined him as you go through the life of Henry Hill and his rise in crime, though the final 1/4 of the movie felt dragging and underdeveloped (leaving the audience not as satisfied as they were throughout the film earlier).",1990,11/23/2021,229,tt0099685

Overall, a decent to pretty good movie that showcases the youth of the 70s in the movie that put Matthew McConaughey on the map, even though it may be a bit overrated and boring at many points.",1993,11/24/2021,230,tt0106677
House of Gucci,4.6,"Pretty Bad Direction (The tone throughout the movie was incredibly inconsistent, the acting as a whole was not properly conveyed (especially with the accents), and many scenes displayed a sense of awkward silence), Bad Acting (Very Good to Great from Lady Gaga (her mannerisms were very spot on, but some moments definitely shinned more than others), Good to Very Good from Adam Driver (Though his accent can get very annoying at times), Terrible from Jared Leto (Possibly one of the worst performances I have every seen, his accent is atrocious and he's comedic when his trying to be serious), Good from Jeremy Irons (his accent was the only believable one in the entire cast), Bad from Salma Hayek (Considering she is just using her Mexican Accent while playing an Italian character), Pretty Good to Good from Al Pacino (Has his iconic Al Pacino charm but there is still something off with his performance), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (though the cut spends way too much on the exposition and the rise of Patrizia Reggiani that the inevitable fall is kinda rushed and not well developed; the storytelling was decent though it was inconsistent on what elements mattered the most in presenting the story), Terrible Screenplay (while the symbolism is prevalent, the actual dialogue was filled with terrible jokes and forced sayings that made the conversations feel incredibly unnatural), Inconsistent Score (the score was used in moments it was needed and was absent in moments it was desperately needed; its absence helped set the inconsistent tone throughout the movie), Good Cinematography, Pretty Good to Good Editing (helped with some of the moments in the film), Good Production Design, Incredible Makeup (considering Jared Leto was unrecognizable), Good to Very Good Costumes (it was supposed to emulate Gucci after all), Plot Structure was prevalent but not effectively carried out (the movie spends too much time on the rise of the unrecognizable Partizia, that the downfall, climax, and resolution are completely rushed and feel like afterthoughts), Pacing felt like it was fine until you realize that there is 30 minutes left of the movie and the real conflict has only started to be introduced (this left the final act incredibly rushed), Build to the climax is present (but the audience is already disinterested in the movie at this point that it is kinda useless); the climax and actual key plot point of the movie is horribly conveyed as it is more comical than dramatic, Tone of the movie possibly is one of the major reasons the movie is held back as the movie does not know when to be serious or comedic and the lack of score and bad acting adds to the confusion of what importance most of these scenes have, The aura of the movie is present as it was good to see the 70s/80s/90s having an effect on the fashion and designs of Gucci and the soundtrack used to help show what time period the film is currently in. Overall, a very poorly executed movie that cannot be saved by performances from Lady Gaga and Adam Driver as the direction, screenplay, tone, and terrible acting make this movie extremely hard to watch and a mess overall.",2021,11/30/2021,231,tt11214590

Overall, a defining comic-book movie that is filled with action, humor, and sadness as we get to see some familiar faces get second chances and get the closure they never got with both their characters and their careers.",2021,12/23/2021,233,tt10872600

Overall, one of the best christmas movies ever made as we get to see the iconic elements carried out by Culkin and the wet bandits as they navigate through the different traps and high jinks, and I would rate this movie higher but I personally prefer the sequel more due to personal reasons.",1990,12/25/2021,234,tt0099785

Overall, a great remake of the original as we get to hear and see new faces, and old, carry out iconic characters and numbers as this new rendition pays homage to the original in may ways while also holding its own as it brings back the flair and numbers that make West Side Story one of the most well-known musicals of all time.",2021,12/25/2021,235,tt3581652

Overall, a good watch that stands the test of time as we get to see George Bailey find out the true importance of life and how valuable it really is in this Christmas classic, even though it falters in its plot structure taking away from its best elements.",1946,12/30/2021,236,tt0038650

Overall, a fun movie to watch that is filled with many memorable quotes and good laughs, but what holds the movie back is it reeking of the 00s Rom-Com archetype with its predictable story and constant cliches, so it would probably be a fun movie to watch in the background or picking it up in the middle on TV.",2005,12/31/2021,237,tt0396269

Overall, a good movie that is carried by the strong performances of the entire cast as we get to see a rare insight into deaf culture, though the movie is held back by it playing way too much to the coming-of-age genre through its cliches and predictable plot.",2021,01/01/2021,238,tt10366460

Overall, a movie carried by Andrew Garfield as he transforms himself into Jonathan Larson as he tells the story of building a legacy and to keep on going (even if you never get to see your success), though it held back by some of its numbers, limited acting/direction, and very bad CGI.",2021,01/06/2022,239,tt8721424

Overall, it is great to see Adam McKay play more to his roots at not taking himself too seriously as he creates a funny comedy that has some real highlights, though he still has a big mess on his hands from a pretty poorly structured plot and forced political message that is not told well.",2021,01/06/2022,240,tt11286314

Overall, a great movie and a very fun watch as we get to see these young characters grow through the different adventures they go on as PT Anderson delivers a great hangout movie that shows why he is one of the most respected filmmakers in the business by getting the most out of his script and elevating very new actors.",2021,01/11/2022,241,tt11271038
Nobody,7.3,"Decent to Pretty Good Direction (Was able to move the story forward decently well even though he could not get the most out of his actors, action scenes were pretty well coordinated), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting overall (Good from Bob Odenkirk, Decent to Pretty Good from RZA, Decent to Pretty Good from Christopher Lloyd, Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (mainly due to inexperience)), Pretty Good Story (it is kinda just an ex-army, John Wick Copy), Decent Screenplay (kinda bland dialogue overall though), Score was not rememberable, Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing (Felt kinda cheap, though the repetitive editing in the beginning is very symbolic in a way that Requiem for a Dream had those sequences), Plot Structure followed the same generic plot structure of a John Wick/Action Movie, Pacing felt very fast (the movie was less than 90 minutes), Build to the climax was very good as it is a culmination of all the action that Odenkirk's character had in him; Climax was good as it was the most action packed moment of the entire movie and was well choreographed, Tone of the movie was very dark and grungy (adds to that John Wick feel), the action scenes were well choreographed as a whole and shared a very similar stylistic choice to John Wick. Overall, a decent watch that was filled with action, though it entirely feels like a John Wick copy (which makes sense given who made the movie).",2021,03/01/2022,242,tt7888964

Overall, a pretty good movie that is filled with many highlights in direction and acting but feels pretty boring as the plot is very minimal and has nothing memorable to go off of.",2021,03/01/2022,243,tt12789558
The Batman,8.1,"Pretty Good Direction (On a macro scale, Reeves did a Great job in setting the tone and laying out the different concepts he wanted from the movie, but on a micro scale, it felt like some of the conversations were not fluid and it felt like a lot of the pieces did not connect), Good Acting (Good from Robert Pattinson (He embodied the Batman role very well as you could tell how committed he was to playing the capped crusader (though physically it seemed he did not work out for it); though, he was not that convincing as Bruce Wayne (a big issue with the movie)), Good from Zoë Kravitz (played the mystery of Selina Kyle very well and stole a good amount of scenes (though some scenes were questionable performances)), Good to Very Good from Paul Dano (for the first 3/4 of the movie it felt like he was really stealing the show, but the final 1/4 of the movie, his performance really falls apart from being the menacing serial killer he is and to becoming a discord mod), Very Good from Jeffrey Wright (Felt like a perfect casting and played the strengths of this role very well), Very Good from Colin Farrell (A real transformation and embodied the character very well (even though it was a bit over the top)), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (Felt very true to the comics and did a great job in putting together a realistic interpretation of Batman), Good Screenplay (The symbolism was prevalent and very well executed in showing its importance, though the dialogue felt very forced and not natural at all), Decent Score (Felt this was kind of a miss from the movie was it felt like the same motif playing over and over again and really takes a back seat to the iconic scores from the previous Batman movies), Great Cinematography (The shift between general shots and reaction shots in the action scenes was a good stylistic choice, and the overall general shots taken was executed very well, but the intentional blur was a bit questionable at points), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Except for a few scenes, overall really liked how a lot of the effects were done without CGI), Great Production Design (Gave an overall dark Gotham feel that the movie was looking for), Very Good Costumes (With the Serial Killer-esque Riddler Costume being the best, Batman had a very realistic costume), Plot Structure was fine for the first 3 acts but as soon as the it starts to get close to the climax (final 1/4 of the movie) it really starts to fall apart with the ending being kinda pointless and a bit boring, Pacing felt good for the most part but for the final third of the movie it really hits how slow and dragging it is (Could have definitely cut 30-40 mins of the movie), Build to climax not good as it feels like (SPOILER ALERT) as the interrogation scene is a bit pointless with nothing being added to the story except for the fact that (SPOILER ALERT) the riddler still won; climax was pretty boring as there were moments in the actual fight scene where it felt like Batman took very questionable moves (Also it just felt like Batman was fighting a bunch of Discord/Reddit mods), Tone was set very nicely as it felt very dark and very Neo-Noir esque in its presentation and dialogue. Overall, a movie that has the potential to set up a good new Batman film series but suffers from a lot of flaws in its first encounter; it will be interesting to see where we are taken next as we follow this new, darker version of Batman.",2022,03/12/2022,244,tt1877830

Overall, Good to Very Good movie that is visually appealing as we go through the mystery of the characters that was a fun and captivating watch, though it is a bit surface level in both its formulaic plot structure and story leaving us wanting more as it feels like nothing really happens.",2021,03/15/2022,245,tt7740496
This is the End,9.2,"Very Good Direction (Considering the entire movie was improv, I feel like Seth and Evan did an impressive Job giving starting points for the actors to work on), Very Good Acting (Movie felt like a masterclass in improv from some of the best comedic talents of the early 2010s as the chemistry with the entire cast felt very fluid with everyone building off each other effortlessly), Good Story (A sleepover type movie with the backdrop of apocalypse mixed with different motifs on faith and judgment, though story is not what really makes the movie what it is; different callbacks to the actor's previous movies was fun to see), Very Good to Great Screenplay (Given that 85% of the movie was improv, the entire movie was incredibly funny as all the jokes built off each other very nicely; Also, the biblical symbolism was a nice touch to a movie that is not meant to be taken that serious on the surface), Score was present/Soundtrack complemented the movie very nicely in both style and comedic fashion, Good Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Bad Visual Effects (Felt very low cost), Plot Structure was very nice as each segment had its purpose in progressing the story forward, Pacing was good as it kept a consistent pace (with no scenes really needed to be cut), Build to climax was very typical of movies from this time (so pretty good); climax was good as it was more important in how it is revelations for the characters rather than the action present, Tone was set very nicely through the different motifs present as the mix of comedy/apocalypse/sleep-over/religious concepts brought something new and fun to see, The reliance on improv was fun to see as it really made the movie more about the characters interacting with each other and building jokes on each other rather than the story itself. Overall, an incredibly funny movie that is a masterclass in improv from some of the most prominent comedic actors of the early 2010s as we got to see how well they work with each other to make a very disastrous, fun scenario.",2013,03/16/2022,246,tt1245492
King Richard,8.6,"Good to Very Good Direction (Cut the right anecdotes and story points to help show the relationship between Richard and his family; got a good amount out of the actors in their scenes, though it felt like there were some points where there was some idle points/awkwardness with the more minor characters), Pretty Good Acting (Incredible Acting by Will Smith (Really transforms into the character of Richard Williams as the transformation of harshness to compassion for his family is fluid throughout the entire movie), Good to Very Good from Aunjanue Ellis (Was a good scene partner to Wll Smith and had moments where she could show off her ability as well), Good from Jon Bernthal (Was more of a minor role but played it very well), decent to pretty good from the rest of the cast), Very Good to Great Story (Outlines the impact that Richard has on the careers of his daughters as his fire and compassion help fuel their tennis careers; the issue with the story is that it is a bit revisionist as it is told from the perspectives of the Williams family (given the sister's roles as Executive producers) and sugarcoats a lot of his horrible nature and kinda makes up some aspects to make it work for the drama; despite this revisionist history, I feel the story still stayed mostly true to what happened and used tennis terminology very well (especially the William's use of open stance and throwing a spiral football for their serve)), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (A bit simple in its dialogue but gets the job done in terms of moving the story forward, some of the lines feel a bit forced as the foreshadowing is very overt), Score was present/Soundtrack was fine but gave the tone a bit more of a happy go lucky type (which I personally am not too much of a fan of), Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Plot Structure was laid out very nicely as each element builds off of each other as we see the progression through Venus (as well as Serena) through their come up in the tennis world, Pacing was good as there really was not any moments where the movie felt like it was rushed or dragging (no need to cut any time), Build to climax was good as it was really building throughout the whole movie (Venus going pro); climax was good as it helped show how cut throat the tennis world can be (even for a prodigy), Tone of the movie was a bit too happy go lucky/feel-good and because of this I felt it really took away from some of the serious/angry moments of Richard Williams, a major problem of the movie was that it is really told from the perspective of Richard Williams and because of this it sugar-coats him and kinda takes away from some of the anger he really had when he worked with the media and others (though it does humanize him which was good to see as he really was trying to make his daughters the best); I did like they focused more on Venus because she really gets overshadowed by the success that Serena has gotten over the years. Overall, a movie that is fueled by the best performance that Will Smith has ever given as he transforms himself into a compassionate father that wants his daughters to succeed, though it does falter from its feel-good tone and its revisionist history given that it is told from the Williams' family perspective (though it gets a lot of small details right which I do applaud).",2021,03/21/2022,247,tt9620288
No Time to Die,8.4,"Very Good Direction (Was able to choreograph the fight and action scenes very well as well as the interpersonal dialogue heavy scenes), Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Daniel Craig (A good send-off performance for the character he is most known for as he really takes command of every scene he is in (though there are some small minor hiccups that take this from going above and beyond his other Bond performances)), Pretty Bad performance from Rami Malek (It felt very lazy and his overall acting and mannerisms did not feel that menacing as a Bond villain), Good from Léa Seydoux (A good scene partner and love interest to Bond), Very Good from Ana de Armas (even though she was barely in the movie, she plays her ditsy, Bond girl character very well), Good to Very Good from Lashana Lynch (Was able to make the most out of the dialogue she was given as she plays the up-incoming, hotshot trope well), Very Good from Jeffrey Wright (A nice return from a memorable Bond character as Wright pays to his strengths very well with this performance), Good from the rest of the main cast (though some questionable performances from some of the minor villains)), Pretty Good to Good Story (The layout of Bond coming out of retirement and why certain pieces tie together make it be a good closure to the whole Daniel Craig Bond Saga; though there were some questionable story elements towards the end (filed with predictable cliches)), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (some of the dialogue was fine but there were some elements where it was easy to predict what was going to be said and what was coming up; it was very obvious where Phoebe Waller-Bridge came in to edit the screenplay to add more comedic elements because it just felt very forced and not funny (though some of the wittier/typical Bond jokes did hit)), Very Good to Great Score (took elements of old Bond themes while also captured new themes to make it work well (this was Hans Zimmer after all)), Very Good Cinematography, Great Sound (Really enjoyed the moments where Bond's hearing is recovering in a fight from close proximity to an explosion), Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects, Plot Structure was good for the most part (I felt the exposition really help play into the trust issues for Bond, but I feel like the resolution was very lackluster), Pacing was good because even though it was a long movie the pacing was consistent for the most part (no need to cut anything), Build to climax was good because it was clear what was needed and how it was important to the story; climax was executed very nicely in terms of action (but in terms of story it was a bit cliche and predictable), Tone was constant for the most part because it tried to be the typical bond movie (but like an older bond who is coming out of retirement one last time (though the break in tone for the comedy scenes were really annoying)), The finishing touches for Craig as bond were displayed very well throughout the movie as you can see him make peace with his time as the character as he shows his experience but also shows his closure at the same time. Overall, a nice conclusion to Daniel Craig as James Bond as we get to see him close out the character on his own terms in a very action packed, emotional manner, but the movie does not really compete with his other movies like Skyfall and Casino Royale due to the subpar screenplay/story and questionable performances from Rami Malek and some of the minor characters.",2021,03/25/2022,248,tt2382320
Drive My Car,8.8,"Great Direction (The way the director was able to get the most out of his actors while also putting together different shots to help display the loneliness and trauma of the characters was great to see), Very Good Acting (Not one performance was better than another (it felt like everyone played their role the way it was meant to be written and played their part in helping display their trauma)), Good to Very Good Story (While the actual plot is minimal and a bit mismanaged, the different points that help show the characters overcoming their trauma was a nice subtle touch), Great to Incredible Screenplay (Even though it is a translation, the screenplay felt very natural and personal; it was as if the characters were letting out all of their emotions when trying to move past the hardships they felt), Score was poorly used (the movie rarely used the score as it opted for more ambient noise, but because of this it felt extremely slow; either use a score or do not use a score, do not just minimally use it), Good Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound, Good Editing, Plot Structure was not managed well (The exposition was almost 30 minutes when it could have been 15, the middle acts could have cut like 20-30 minutes as most of it is just white noise/characters not really doing anything, and the resolution kinda felt out of place as it is part of the ""covid"" world when it really did not need to set in a contemporary world), Pacing was bad as the entire movie felt like it was dragging (Because the movie felt like it was 30-45 minutes longer than it should, it just has a lot of emptiness in it that makes the overall move feel slower (which does not help when they do not use a score)), Build to climax was prevalent (though a bit too prevalent) as it really shows what the characters need and how they are going to get it; climax was executed very well as it is the most touching part of the movie (with the characters leaving everything out there and attempting to move on with their lives), tone was consistent throughout as it was a somber tone the mimic the state of the characters, A movie that handles dealing with trauma very well as we can see how these characters are effected by their past actions and how they are holding onto the past (which is not allowing them to move forwards). Overall, a very well made and written movie that looks at the effects of holding on to trauma and the importance of letting go as we see all the characters be parts of a well oiled machine, but where the movie really fails with its extremely long runtime and mismanaged plot structure as it really feels like the movie is dragging a lot (something the viewer has to get past to see the hidden beauty).",2021,03/27/2022,249,tt14039582
The Power of the Dog,8.6,"Very Good to Great Direction (The different choices she made were stylistically very beautiful and artistic, though I did feel she made some questionable choices more for shock value), Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Benedict Cumberbatch (A performance that showed both the harshness of a man while also highlighting his closeted nature), Very Good from Kirsten Dunst (Was able to capture a woman who spirals into a dark alcoholic state very well as the change in action from hope to losing herself is seen through her performance), Good from Jesse Plemons (was a more calmer foil to the harshness of the main character, which limited the availability he could give with this performance), Pretty Good to Good from Kodi Smit-McPhee (the character was not really written that well as it is more of a nerdy, not strong character that uses more of subtly than overt actions, but I also did not see him go above and beyond in this role either), ), Good to Very Good Story (felt the different parts of the movie were spread out pretty well and the actually closeted nature of the main character was foreshadowed throughout the movie; moreover, the subtle actions of the character really do come around full circle towards the end), Good to Very Good Screenplay (the dialogue was well written but the main point of this move is the use of its subtly (even though it may be too much) and use of heavy symbols), Very Good Score (really had that western fell and was used very effectively to help show the tense nature of a scene and to keep the movie rolling), Very Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Incredible Production Design (I really felt the location choice for filming along with the sets were very beautiful and helped capture the beauty of the west very well (a very similar feeling I got from Brokeback Mountain)), Good Costumes (really liked the western feel a lot as there was the western hardworking men juxtaposed by the elite (similar feel to Red Dead Redemption)), Plot Structure was good for the most part as the movie was effectively laid out into different acts that helped with the pacing (though the last two acts did feel very rushed), Pacing was good for the most part as I felt the score helped give it a good steady pace (but I felt that the movie is really rushed towards the end and could have benefited from 10-15 more minutes), Build to climax was extremely abrupt as it heavily relies on the audience paying attention to the subtly of the characters and what they did in their past acts; climax is more just thrown on us because the director wants us to piece together the subtly to make a conclusion on what happened (something I was not really a fan of), Tone of the movie was very harsh/western for the first 3/4 but then becomes a bit more lighter towards the end (which I was not really a fan off cause it was a little too late), The movie relies way too much on subtly as a method of communicating meaning and I feel that it is too much (causing a worse viewing experience than if it was a mix of dialogue/subtly); there is a major shift in the movie between two characters and after that point the movie really loses its charm as the pacing is very rushed and the ending is really thrown at us as we have to draw conclusions on what happened (which I really thought was a lazy tie up). Overall, a movie that is very artistic in its use of subtly and production design as we follow a cowboy come to terms with his own identity, but even though the movie is well made, it falters from relying too much on subtly and ultimately leaves the audience with more questions in the end.",2021,04/06/2022,250,tt10293406

Overall, a classic that still holds up very well as a very well written story mixed with some of the best talent of the time makes the movie a film noir that is very similar to the time in its presentation but very different in how it lays the plot together and how things finish off (though it does falter a bit in its plot structure and pacing of different elements).",1974,04/11/2022,251,tt0071315

Overall, an action movie with a lot of action sequences that were carried out nicely and had good moments, but lacks a well structured plot and screenplay that could not save the themes and relationships they were trying to portray.",1994,04/19/2022,252,tt0110413

Overall, A revolutionary film that still holds up since it premiered as it incorporated many groundbreaking elements that are used by films to come as Orson Welles defines a new generation of filmmaking, even though it did run very fast to the point were it was hard to pay attention to what was going on.",1941,04/27/2022,253,tt0033467

Overall, a well written movie that was a fun watch with some good performances but plays a little too safe and kinda falls apart towards the end.",2000,04/29/2022,254,tt0181875

Jackson (had limited range throughout the performance but it was easy to see where he had to let go of the direction he was given), Acting on a Spectrum from the rest of the cast (Bad from the rest of the live-action cast; Great voice acting (really brought to life the iconic performances of their characters))), Incredible Story (The actual structure and storyline was very well told cause it really bridges the descent Anakin has in being the chosen one to falling to the darkside through the illusion that it will help Padme (especially really shown in the final hour)), Bad Screenplay (To where it is memorable and iconic; None of the language was natural and felt very forced (but there are just so many memorable lines from how bad they were written that I loved it; the foreshadowing and symbolism actually is told very well (giving further proof that Lucas is a good Storyteller but terrible dialogue writer))), Incredible to Brilliant Score (One of the best John Williams scores he has ever made), Great to Incredible Cinematography (especially in the scenes where the subjects are small pieces of a large canvas), Good Editing (The cuts between different shots was Great but the transitions between scenes felt very lazy), Great to Incredible Visual Effects (Especially considering when the movie was made and a majority of it is through Green screen and effects), Incredible Production Design, Incredible Makeup, Incredible Costumes, Plot Structure was laid out very nicely as all the elements really built off of each other and every element played an importance, Pacing was great as it really kept a steady pace throughout (with no need to add or cut on runtime), Build to climax was incredible as the final hour of the movie was building to the fall of the Jedi; Climax was incredible as it was one of the best moments in Star Wars history (especially the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan fight), Tone was very typical of the prequels and Star Wars (but the darker tones were a night touch as it brought a depressing aspect with glimpses of hope), The movie was a real redemption for the prequels as we already expected the bad aspects of the movie yet we were still surprised the grandeur and level of story writing which makes this movie an iconic story in the Star Wars saga. Overall, An incredible story with the technical achievements that really make this movie a must watch and a favorite of mine as it helps bridge the prequels with the original trilogy, even though it does reek of the bad dialogue and direction that the rest of the prequels suffer from.",2005,05/11/2022,255,tt0121766
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,7.0,"Good Direction (Was able to take control of the different action scenes as well as the different character building scenes, all while sprinkling in different elements of horror that makes Sam Raimi famous), Good Acting (Very good from Benedict Cumberbatch (Continued his role as he now has the weight of carrying the Marvel franchise in this new phase), Good from Elizabeth Olsen (While there were many holes/I did not like her character, Olsen did a good job in trying to portray what they were going for in Wanda in this movie), Good from Benedict Wong (Standard Wong), Very Good from Xochitl Gomez (I really enjoyed her performance as she played the teenage character with potential archetype very well (and I look forward to seeing more America Chavez in latter MCU content)), Good from Rachel McAdams (played the ex-love interest very well), Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Bad Story (The entire story was very formulaic and easy to predict (took from the standard comic book boilerplate), and the Wanda Storyline was very poorly written to the point that it was more annoying than entertaining; also, there were many plot holes when it came to the multiverse), Decent Screenplay (Typical Marvel Dialogue but there were many questionable lines that were more cringey than entertaining), Good Score, Very Good Cinematography, Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Similar to previous Doctor Strange), Good Costumes, Plot Structure was very formulaic as it followed the standard MCU/Superhero boilerplate (But it spends way too much time in the exposition to where the rest of the movie does not have that much time), Pacing was incredibly fast as the shortened runtime was easy to see (would have liked to have seen 20 minutes added towards the rising action), Build to climax stood out and had good moments despite being overall pretty standard MCU; climax was the typical MCU climax (but had some moments that were very cringey), Tone was the standard MCU tone (but I did enjoy some of the horror touches and homage to his earlier horror films). Overall, a highly anticipated Marvel movie that plays too strongly to its predecessors as it is very formulaic in the MCU boilerplate and has pretty poor writing overall, but has some highlights when it comes to acting, direction, visuals, and new stylistic choices that make it a bit different from other MCU movies (even though by not a lot).",2022,05/23/2022,256,tt9419884

Overall, a epic that is a good watch filled with many good performances, great cinematography, and well carried out action scenes, but is still simplistic given the plot and how cliche/predictable it got at times.",2022,05/24/2022,257,tt11138512
Saturday Night Fever,7.1,"Pretty Good Direction (Able to move the movie forward and executes the dancing sequences very well, but besides this, he really does not get that much out of his actors and there are a lot of questionable scenes), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Very Good from John Travolta (In a very ""John Travolta"" way, a film that really puts him on the map for his exaggerated character), Decent from Karen Lynn Gorney (Has some good moments and has some questionable ones), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (A lot of the characters play the stereotypical New York Italian and it just gets so annoying to watch/listen to after a while)), Decent Story (Pretty formulaic and easy to predict, nothing really of substance), Decent Screenplay (As a whole, it is fine and gets the job done (very surface level), but there are just way to many stereotypical Italian mannerisms that it gets annoying), Great to Incredible Soundtrack (The actual songs were Incredible, but there were moments where I felt the director did not use the soundtrack properly (like reusing songs)), Pretty Good Cinematography (The cinematography comes to life in the dancing scenes as I liked the very low angle shots to show how big of a dancer Travolta's character was), Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Good Costumes (Very Disco-esque attire), Plot Structure was structured pretty well with no major problems (except the end kinda falls apart as it really could have ended 10-15 minutes earlier), Pacing was fine, Build to climax was not well done as the movie builds to the competition as if it is th the climax but the real climax is after (therefore, it just feels like it was building to nothing); climax was kinda boring as it was not what the movie was building to, Tone was very 70s/disco/New York Italian and it was made very clear with the dialogue and the mannerisms the characters have, The actual message of the movie is good but it is just so hard to believe as the character of John Travolta goes back to his foolish/degenerate ways right after as soon as he has his epiphany; also the movie really did not age well with its themes and language (but I guess it tried to portray the average New York Italian youth in that era). Overall, a movie with highlights in John Travolta's performance, soundtrack, and dancing sequences, but really has some misses in other aspects as it misses the mark in terms of its writing and other performances.",1977,05/30/2022,258,tt0076666
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,9.3,"Great to Incredible Direction (Really moves the story forward and gets the best out of his actors as it drives the audience to be enticed with what happens next throughout the story), Great Acting (No one performance stands out as everyone acts as a unit to progress the story forward), Great to Incredible Story (really captivating on seeing how the journey progresses as we see the Fellowship go on this quest to Mordor, also the different elements of the story are very important as they comeback to play a role in the film), Great Screenplay (While the very ""Middle English""-esque text is hard to follow sometimes, the actual dialogue is very well written as we see the director use it well to help tell the story (especially in the narration parts); also, the symbolism throughout the movie (specifically, about a boy who is trying to grow up and be a hero trope)), Great Score (with memorable themes), Pretty Good Cinematography (While for the most part it was very good at capturing the scenes, I found the slow-shaky shots incredibly annoying), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (While there were some hiccups, the CGI was incredible for its time), Great Production Design, Great Makeup, Very Good Costumes, Plot Structure was well laid out as it is about a 1/3 of a full-length story (and treats it as such with all the elements of a solo movie, yet still taking into account there is more to go), Pacing was very fast (especially for a movie that is 3 hours long) as it felt like they were trying to fit so much in (which does make sense given how dense the books are), Build to climax was good as we get to see them embark on one arc of their journey to Mordor; climax was well executed as we get to see the sacrifices the characters have to make to go on their quest, Tone was stereotypical of the fantasy genre (as it treated as such), Given this movie is the first of three parts Peter Jackson does a great job in setting the story and the conflict that the other movies will take off from as we see the internal struggles present in all the characters and the importance of what is needed to be done from the quest (so it is acceptable to treat the movie as an overall exposition even though it has elements of a solo movie). Overall, a great introduction into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy as the execution and different parts are well done to start this epic story off as the audience is left wanting more from the characters and the story as they transition into the next part.",2001,05/30/2022,259,tt0120737

Overall, an iconic movie that is a fun watch but really does reek of the 80s with its writing and acting as the audience has to get past the pretty simple plot to see the moments that make Top Gun a famous movie for its time.",1986,06/03/2022,260,tt0092099

Overall, a great action movie that is far better than the original as it builds off of the first movie very well through its well executed action/fighter pilot scenes and improved personal scenes, making this legacy sequel a must watch to relive old memories created from the original movie.",2022,06/04/2022,261,tt1745960

Overall, one of the worst movies ever created with how much money was put into this and the output they got as there is not a single good thing to say about this movie (and I really hope nobody has to go through the struggle of having to see it, even for the meme).",2022,06/07/2022,262,tt5108870

Very Good to Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (Really excelled at playing the naive kid who is interested in helping very well, shows a bit of inexperience but that is to be accepted when he is playing a very young character that is the hero), Very Good to Great from Harrison Ford (The real star of the show in all his scenes as his smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (though there are moments that are kinda iffy with the awkwardness and silence from line deliveries)), Pretty Good from Carrie Fisher (Her performance does not compete with the others but she does play the damsel in distress character trope very well (though it is a bit annoying when she is changing between accents as it sounds like she is putting on a fake English accent at times)), Pretty Good to Good from Peter Cushing (Not really that much in the movie despite his high billing), Great from Alec Guinness (Really shows his experience as an actor in this performance as he has much range in showing both care for Luke yet trauma from his past that still effects him), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (Really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (Created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Brilliant Story (Created a world that is one of the most iconic today; the character writing is incredible as they are some of the most iconic characters in pop culture; the way the story ties all the different movies together (both prequel and later films) is very well done and visionary), Very Good Screenplay (The actual dialogue was not that well written as it felt very unnatural (as was seen from the characters trying to say the words), but where the screenplay shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines, and character writing to introduce the Star Wars universe as a cinematic achievement), Brilliant Score (One of the most iconic scores in cinema history and is very well used throughout the movie), Great Cinematography, Incredible Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life), Very Good to Great Editing, Cannot rate Visual Effects (The original Visual Effects were incredible for how revolutionary they were at the time of the release, but the added CGI from the re-release makes it very hard to watch as it just feels so forced and out of place with the original effects), Incredible Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as each piece builds on the previous one as everything matters in building up the movie and moving the story forward (so nothing to really add or remove), Pacing can be a bit slower at times but does maintain a very steady pace throughout the movie (pace very typical of movies from that time-period), Build to climax was very well done as the movie treats the actual build as the climax (so we are building to this build very nicely throughout the movie); Climax was kinda thrown at us as in the grand scheme of things we did not build to this (we built up to the build as previously stated) but it was very well executed and really shows off the technical marvels that the original film was very groundbreaking for; moreover helps provide some insight into Luke's quest in finding the force and taking his first step in becoming a Jedi, Tone was that typical to a space opera or science fiction epic but does have some unique feel to it that makes it very Star Wars, A ground-breaking movie not only in Cinema-history but actual history as well as it ushered in a new way to view and create stories and was an inspiration for the rise in the Science-Fiction genre in the 80s and 90s. Overall, an important movie to watch in what created one of the most iconic franchises in the world and helped jump-start a story that is beloved by many through its technical achieves and story-writing, even though the direction is a bit lacking.",1977,06/12/2022,263,tt0076759
The Graduate,8.6,"Great Direction (Really was able to get a lot from his actors and used the different camera angles and editing to help tell the story and get the most out of a movie that is very simple on paper), Very Good Acting (Great from Anne Bancroft (Really plays the dynamic of the older person trying to take advantage of the younger very well while also showing a range of emotion when trying to protect her daughter, overall showed her experience with this role), Very Good from Dustin Hoffman (Started off very slow as it was not that believable that he could be an anxious young adult, but he got better and better as the performance went on as he really began to steal the show the further the movie progressed and he got more comfortable (an analogy to his character in the movie itself)), Good to Very Good from Katharine Ross (shows up pretty late into the movie but does show some range in her character towards the end as she begins to have feelings for Hoffman's character), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast), Very Good Story (A tale of two movies: the first part dealt with the uncertainty of graduation and did a good job doing so as the main character dives deeper into exploring his independence, the second part deals with the more typical rom-com movie of parents disapproving of this love/love-triangle; while the transition between these two parts is very abrupt as it does not flow well, the connection between the beginning and the end is better), Very Good Screenplay (the actual conversational dialogue is very well written (with iconic lines), but some of the lines are a little too on-the-nose (like when he talks about not knowing his future); the symbolism of water is also used throughout as it helps provide truth and wash away sins committed from the past), Great Score/Soundtrack (Uses three different songs for the different parts of the movie and does a good job building themes and renditions that weave into the story very well, also the songs are very iconic in themselves), Incredible Cinematography (Especially the different angles they used and the mirroring techniques they had (something that is very ahead of its time)), Very Good Sound, Incredible Editing (The transition between shots was very seamless and really seemed groundbreaking given when this movie was created (examples of this are when Hoffman's character transitions from going to the pool to seeing Mrs. Robinson and some of the Hotel scene shots)), Plot Structure was not the best structured as it felt like a movie with in two big parts (the Ben-Mrs.Robinson relationship and the Ben-Elaine relationship) with the last part into itself being split into two parts (so this makes the movie feel very unbalanced in its structure as it favors the first part a lot), Pacing was not that well maintained as the first half felt fine but the second half felt like it was dragging as it starts when a typical rise to the climax should happen (so 15-10 minutes could have between cut from the first half to make it seen more balanced), Build to climax was well done as it pretty standard for the typical Rom-Com (but since this is a movie from the past it may be that other later films have taken from this so that actually might make it revolutionary); climax was a bit chaotic as so much happens at once and kinda makes it hard to concentrate (also it is very fast); the movie also kinda ends abruptly with no conclusion (but that may be intentional for symbolic purposes), Tone was actually well established as it shifts from uncertainty to having a clear vision (with both being the guise of a rom-com), For a movie that is over 50 years it is very groundbreaking in what it does with direction/cinematography and is a pioneer in the rom-com genre that many movies later on most likely take from. Overall, a movie that is a very good watch and has things to watch for (like direction and acting) as we get to see Dustin Hoffman enter the Hollywood scene with a very comedic movie that is groundbreaking in the rom-com genre, but the film suffers from a very imbalanced plot structure as it favors the Mrs.Robinson relationship a lot more than it should.",1967,06/14/2022,264,tt0061722

Overall, an impactful movie for its time that is shot very well but is so poorly written that it is really hard to watch at times, and the movie is a copy of Superbad and it really shows.",2012,06/17/2022,265,tt1636826
Saving Private Ryan,9.5,"Incredible to Brilliant Direction (The way he was able to conduct shots and scenes on a mass scale was a masterclass as it was truly a spectacle to watch the grotesque nature of war as it places its subjects into mass trauma; the interpersonal scenes were also well carried out as he is able to capture the trauma the characters are experiencing through World War II), Very Good to Great Acting (Great from Tom Hanks (does a great job in portraying the leader who has to move past his present trauma to lead his men (really commands all the scenes he is in)), Very Good to Great from Matt Damon (Although he is not in the movie for long, he really does a good job in portraying the emotion of someone who has so much to live for yet has already lost so much), Very Good to Great from the rest of the cast (everyone (even Vin Diesel) plays their part very well no matter how big or small it is)), Good Story (At its core it is pretty simple as it is just the characters going on a mission that they do not want to go on (but have to to serve their country); but the different elements of the character's journey was a good touch to see), Great Screenplay (The dialogue was very well written and naturally flowed from the characters and the use of symbolism in trying to find purpose greater than one's self as well as dealing with trauma was very well written), Very Good Score, Incredible Cinematography (And this shows during the war scenes (especially D-Day)), Incredible Sound, Great Editing, Brilliant Visual Effects (Especially the ability to capture the gore of war), Great Makeup (In helping show the dirt and gore of war), Plot Structure was managed well as the movie really starts with a 30 minute prologue of D-Day followed by the actual movie (which is well structured), Pacing was good for the most part (though some of the middle conflict could have been cut by like 10-15 minutes to help with length), Build to climax was incredible as it shows the mission coming to a close (but not fully completed); climax was well executed as it really symbolizes the scarifies the characters make for the country and those who are and are not willing to put their body on the line to defend it, Tone was a war movie mixed with one of character's dealing with trauma as both aspects synergize to create a well made tone that keeps the audience captivated, One of the best representations of War and Trauma I have seen as the gore and dangerous elements of the war paint a realistic picture of how traumatic the overall experience was for the characters and how they have to go through it to finish their job. Overall, and incredible movie that is a must watch to see the effects trauma has on soldiers of war who want to get out but cannot due to the duty they have to serve to their country.",1998,06/28/2022,266,tt0120815

Jaws,8.1,"Good to Very Good Direction (for an amateur director at the time, he does a really good just in executing what he wants and how he wants to architect his movie and story; while there were some shots that were well executed, some of the horror moments really showed signs of amateur film-making), Pretty Good Acting (Good from Roy Scheider (Does a good job playing the lead of the film but really does not go above and beyond in any way), Good from Robert Shaw (Plays his role well but is a bit discombobulating at times), Very Good from Richard Dreyfuss (The most animated out of all the characters and shows a full range of emotion that goes above and beyond the other characters), Pretty Good to Good from Murray Hamilton (Plays the Town Mayor who is unethical trope and has no major issues in the performance), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (A revolutionary story for movies that came after it but is pretty simplistic in what actually happens), Pretty Good Screenplay (Even though there are iconic lines, the overall screenplay was a bit simple and bland, with some questionable dialogue at times), Great Score (Fueled by an iconic theme that is widely know today), Good to Very Good Cinematography, Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (especially for the time), Plot Structure was pretty simplistic and really lacks an resolution, Pacing was fine (no major complaints), Build to climax was present and decently executed as you know it is there; climax was well executed but was a bit long (could have been shortened for like 10 minutes and given it to a resolution), Tone was pretty similar to that of other horror-hunting movies.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,8.6,"Very Good to Great Direction (Takes a step back from the previous movie as this movie is more about moving the story forward (which is does a great job at) but introduces many new things in this film that it is a bit hard to follow at times), Very Good Acting (All the performances still act as pieces to a larger part but they are not as powerful as they were in the first film (specifically Gandolf) but Gollum did improve in this movie substantially), Good to Very Good Story (The story is still very captivating but there are so many parallel plots going that introduce new story elements so quickly that is a bit confusing at times on what is happening), Great Screenplay (Similar to the first film; while the very ""Middle English""-esque text is hard to follow sometimes, the actual dialogue is very well written as we see the director use it well to help tell the story (especially in the narration parts); also, the symbolism throughout the movie (specifically, about a boy who is trying to grow-up and be a hero trope)), Great Score (with memorable themes, and actually may be a bit better this movie), Very Good Cinematography (An improvement from the last film as there are more grandiose shots that are well executed), Great Sound, Very Good to Great Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (For the most part the CGI is good but there are more noticeable hiccups in this movie than the previous (especially in the mix between Live-Action and CGI)), Great Production Design, Great Makeup, Very Good Costumes, Plot Structure just feels like it is moving the story forward and not like a separate film in the trilogy (like the first film) so there really is no typical plot structure, Pacing was very fast (especially for a movie that is 3 hours long) as it felt like they were trying to fit so much in (which does make sense given how dense the books are) but unlike the last film I do not think it does as good of a job as it did in the previous one, Build to climax was good as it builds up to different epic battles that the characters must fight; climax was well executed as it goes between the different story line climaxes very well to keep the audience engaged, Tone was stereotypical of the fantasy genre (as it treated as such), This movie feels more like it is moving the story forward in the trilogy (the rising action/building the overall conflict) so it should be treated as such (making it less of a stand alone movie as the previous one). Overall, a movie that is more about building the story in the trilogy rather than being experienced on its own with it more concerned about transitioning to the next part to see how the trilogy concludes (which makes it not hit the mark as well as the previous one).",2002,06/28/2022,269,tt0167261

Jordan were not the best but besides that she was able to hold her own), Good to Very Good from Dolph Lundgren (really took a once 1-dimensional character and gave him more personality to where you sympathize with his struggle), Decent from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (Some elements of the story were way too safe/mismanaged (the overall plot of fighting from the perspective of Creed (like the default in the first fight)), but I did enjoy the elements when it came to Rocky (and how it closed the character's story line), Drago (and how his story closed his arc from Rocky 4), and the Baby), Decent Screenplay (The scenes when it came to Rocky and Drago were very well written and had that charm of the old movies, but all the scenes regarding just Creed and his relationship with other characters (besides Rocky) were pretty poorly written/felt unnatural), Good Score (mixed the allusions to the original movies nicely), Very Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Good Makeup, Plot Structure was a bit mismanaged as it felt they were trying to fit in a little too much into this movie and did not have enough time to do so (though the moments from building to the climax to the resolution were executed very well), Pacing was alright, Build to climax was very typical of Rocky but was overall very good (a real turning point for the movie); climax had decent execution (it was basically the same as the last movie), Tone was a little bit too much to that of a sports movie when rocky is really not about that (rocky is about someone finding themselves (it just happens to be in the context of boxing), and the touch of becoming a father was nice but really does not help too much in this regard), The emotional touches of this movie were well done and the film was an overall good conclusion to the Rocky Balboa character as he gets closure in something he has been hoping for for so long. Overall, a movie that is a good conclusion to Rocky's story line and has really good moments when it comes to his and the legacy characters, but is really held back by the Creed core in terms of the depth they can really go.",2018,07/03/2022,270,tt6343314

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,9.7,"Great Direction (The actual moving of the story and making sure all pieces come together is incredible managed and executed, and this movie is a definite improvement in directing people than its predecessor as the director was really able to get more out of his actors in their performances for this time around), Very Good to Great Acting (Very Good from the Live-Action Cast; Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (showed the progress he has made from being a naive/hopeful kid to someone more cognizant of the present and the work he needs to put in to be a better Jedi), Great from Harrison Ford (the real star of the show in all his scenes as he smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (and he really cleaned up the delivery of his lines in this movie as there are not any awkward pauses as there were last time), Good to Very Good from Carrie Fisher (She really improves this time around as she is given more freedom to play as opposed to last time; she also really grows as a character from being the damsel in distress to being a loving leader), Good to Very Good from Billy Dee Williams (Really becomes a memorable presence in all the scenes he is in with his cool nature that conflicts/competes with Han, though there is some hiccups in delivery as he is still getting used to the Star Wars universe as opposed to the other members of the cast), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship; and really grows the character to show how loving he is towards his new friends), Great to Incredible from Frank Oz (Really brought the character of Yoda to life with the puppeteering and the vocal performance, Good to Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Incredible Story (Really sets up different elements of the universe very nicely and uses the concept of parallel storylines very well; also has some of the most iconic moments of the series and does a good job in building the downfall of the characters; the only issue this time around is that it does not have the ability to build worlds like the previous film could), Great Screenplay (The dialogue this time around felt way more natural and was better written; the screenplay still shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines (with it having one of the most iconic lines/plot twists in cinema (or even narrative) history)), Brilliant Score (Takes what was great from the previous film and adds some new themes that really make this score stand out as well), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Which really stands out in the Luke vs. Vader scene), Very Good Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life, but there are some issues with Sound in this movie as there feels like a delayed sound with the lightsabers (which is very annoying if you have watched the prequels)), Very Good to Great Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (This movie does not really go overboard with the new visuals of the re-release as much as the other movies so it is easier to comment on), Incredible to Brilliant Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history, and really added to that with the Hoth/Dagobah/Bespin sets which are regarded as some of the best in all of Star Wars), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as it has three major parallel story lines that all converge to the climax and the end (something that helps keep the audience engaged to see how the different arcs are coming along), Pacing was better in this movie as it felt more consistent and not as slow as the last one, Build to climax is done very nicely as it is really pivots the franchise into seeing who these characters really are as they have to make important decisions for the future; Climax was the best part of the movie as we get to see what Luke's training has come to/seeing the rest of the crew into action as we get to see how much the characters have grown yet see how far they really are to their goals in the sage; moreover one of the most important lines in history is delivered in this climax that make Star Wars a franchise memorable, Tone does not play as much into the space opera or science fiction epic as the last one but does have shades of it; feels more like a standout movie that really transcends genre in many ways (while still keeping the same star wars charm), Really can be felt of as a stand alone movie (even though it leaves so much to be answered with its ending) as we get to see the rise and fall of the characters as they must continue their own individual quests to grow as characters. Overall, a brilliant movie that really builds on where the last movie left off and improves on it in so many ways to make it a very memorable film that is not only the best in the series but in film history as we see a more mature Star Wars in the characters that take part in it.",1980,07/03/2022,272,tt0080684
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,8.4,"Very Good to Great Direction (Really enjoyed the mechanical yet cartoonish feel as it really felt like it helped set the tone of the movie being in a factory as well as it being a Roald Dahl story; also, the direction of actors was fine enough to where there were no major issues), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Johnny Depp (Really was the commanding figure that is needed from Willy Wonka; was able to switch between a cheerful yet apathetic man who is deeply effected by his past trauma very well as these transitions are seamless yet cartoony to a feel that makes sense for the movie), Good to Very Good from Freddie Highmore (plays his role well as the cheerful and hopeful boy who is the moral compass for the movie), Pretty Good to Good from David Kelly, Good from Helena Bonham Carter, Good from Christopher Lee (plays a very Christopher Lee role that is toned down a bit for a children's movie), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (In terms of how iconic of a story the film is based from, it really does a good job in painting the world created by Dahl; the only issues with the story come towards the end as it really feels to drag on as we get to the final two kids), Good Screenplay (A very cartoony, kid-friendly script that plays to a Dahl story pretty well; also, good use of foreshadowing throughout (though it makes it a bit predictable)), Good Score, Good to Very Good Cinematography (It does a good job in helping us come into this world as each of the different rooms has its own type of style (with the last kids room having a Kubrick esque approach given the movie they are watching is 2001: A Space Odyssey)), Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (though it was a bit easy to see the limitations that early 2000s CGI had in making this movie), Great Production Design (The sets really brought this film to life with its ability to tell the story of the rooms/scenes it was in), Good Costumes (More so for Willy Wonka as his costume really steals the show for the film), Plot Structure was a major issue that holds this film back because it spends way too much time in the exposition (the film gets to the start of the factory tour at the 40 minute mark) so the movie really seems to drag and become forgettable after the second child (so the movie really should have cut 15-20 minutes from the film (especially the background scenes for Willy Wonka)), Pacing is fine for a good portion but really starts to drag after the second child is over (given by the issues from the plot structure), Build to climax was pretty anti-climatic and really is not that interesting because the movie has really dragged on for so much that it is pretty hard for the audience to care; climax was pretty uneventful as it is more about Willy Wonka facing his demons rather than the actual climax for the meat of the movie (the tour), Tone was very well established as cartoony and mechanical as Burton does a really good job establishing this throughout the film; i was also a fan of the more darker approach it takes at some moments, I have not watched the original movie so it is hard for me to compare both of these movies. Overall, a good movie that is well made and driven by its Director and lead actor (Johnny Depp) as it is fun to see us go into the world of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but it suffers from a mismanaged plot structure to the point where the final 30 minutes really feels like a chore to go through.",2005,07/04/2022,273,tt0367594

Overall, its just a kids movie with adorable moments, but not that serious of a movie (even though the social media marketing has made it an importance to go see this movie (which I do love)).",2022,07/07/2022,275,tt5113044
Elvis,7.3,"Pretty Good Direction (Did a decent job in getting the most out of his actors and was able to help build the overarching narrative very well, the issue was the actual plot points felt very rushed and jammed in to where it really was hard to help move the story forward; also, feels very similar to his other movies in terms of style (at least The Great Gatsby); another issue in his direction is that he tries to build stuff up but when events actually happen they are a bit subpar/lackluster), Good Acting (Incredible to Brilliant from Austin Butler (Really embodied and encapsulated Elvis to a T, it was also incredible that he was singing for the most part (at least the younger version of Elvis)), Good from Tom Hanks (played more to his experience here as he did what he could with the character given there was really not that much for him to work with), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Bad Story (The movie does have pretty important elements in Elvis' life but tries to jam in so many different points from his life that it never does a good job in explaining any of them and just feels rushed overall; also, the movie makes a lot of liberties at changing the narrative of the true story to make it play more favorably in Elvis' way/dramatize the movie), Good Screenplay (Nothing major with the dialogue and does a good job in helping work it around Elvis, but the narration elements of the story were a bit annoying but understandable), Pretty Bad Score/Soundtrack (The actual songs were fine, it was just annoying to hear contemporary music being played in a biopic from the 50s-70s because they should have just used music from that time-period (or at least make new songs that sound like music from then) to give it a more authentic feel of music Elvis would create), Very Good Cinematography (Very similar to other Baz Luhrmann), Good Sound, Great Editing (does a good job in helping make it feel more like a storybook), Good Visual Effects (while there were some hiccups in the beginning and it can be a lot at times, I feel like overall it does a good job in helping it give that storybook feel), Great Makeup (really helped put on the weight of the actors very well), Good Costumes (Helps give that Elvis feel), Plot Structure was the biggest flaw of this movie as the movie tries to jam in so many different points into Elvis' life that it does not do a good job in explaining any of it; also it still tries to follow a traditional plot structure as it is a biopic but with everything else it really hinders it from being a well structured plot, Pacing is incredibly fast even with a 2 hour and 40 minute runtime as the movie tries to fit in too much (the movie should have cut out about 30-40 minutes and go more in-depth to the points), Build to climax was decent but a bit simplistic; climax was a captivating part of the movie but was a bit simplistic in its execution; also it was nice to see a full falling action and resolution but these elements could have been cut a bit shorter to help with the runtime, Tone was very similar to other Baz Luhrmann movies as it very extravagant in its presentation and showmanship to his other movies (which is a good thing given the subject of the movie).

Overall, a cult classic that is an embodiment of deadpan humor as the filmmakers really tried to get the most out of what they could from a low-budget movie, and it really shows.",2004,07/07/2022,277,tt0374900

Overall, a movie that has a huge following and big impact on the sci-fi genre as it begs many questions about humanity and what it means to be alive, but does not live up to such a high billing as it is poorly executed by its director and actors to the point that is is pretty hard to pay attention and watch due to how boring it is.",1982,07/15/2022,278,tt0083658

Overall, a movie that is poorly executed and cannot be saved with Thor's charm as it tries too hard to be funny with its meta jokes and constant volume of jokes (even when it mostly does not work) as this takes away from actually building a storyline that should really be developed, the relationship between Thor and Jane and how Thor comes to terms with being at the end of his character arc.",2022,07/15/2022,279,tt10648342

The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,6.3,"Decent to Pretty Good Direction (Directs the movie as if it is a early 2010s comedy (which kinda is a big drawback given its almost a decade later, but does a good job in moving the story forward and getting a good amount out of his characters)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Nicolas Cage (He is basically playing himself in an exaggerated way so there really is not that much room for error), Good from Pedro Pascal (Does a good job in building off of Cage as someone who admires the actor's work (While also showing his ability to act as well)), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (It is a fun concept that can only go so far but the movie does a good job in being entertaining for what it is (Though it is filled with many cliches to make it very feel-good and the style the movie is trying to emulate)), Pretty Good Screenplay (Overall simplistic screenplay with good funny moments that make the movie entertaining), Score was very typical of 2010s movies in how it is used, Pretty Good Cinematography (was a fan of the filter they used throughout the movie), Decent Sound (Similar to that of other action comedies), Decent Editing, Decent Visual Effects, Plot Structure was nicely laid out and very safe in that it is similar to other action comedies, Pacing was a bit on the faster side at some points but is overall pretty nice (no need to add or cut any material), Build to climax was very cliche and very similar to that of action comedy movies of the 2010s; climax was entertaining in how a action comedy can be, Tone was way too much like that of a early 2010s action comedy movies (which is kinda troubling given that this movie comes out after a decade later). Overall, an entertaining movie that has some funny moments and noticeable acting (especially with Nic Cage), but reeks too much like a early 2010s comedy to the point where it feels very dated in its style (that is this movie would be a lot better if it came out 10 years earlier).",2022,08/20/2022,289,tt11291274
John Wick,6.7,"Pretty Bad Direction (The choreography of action sequences was very well done (Some of the best I have seen), but the moving of the story forward and the direction of actors was bad considering how dull the movie really was), Bad Acting (Pretty Good from Keanu Reeves (Able to handle the action sequences in a great way and is a strong prominent figure throughout the movie (With some good moments in dramatic acting), but has some really questionable scenes that may be in fault from the direction he was given), Acting on a Spectrum from the rest of the cast (Anywhere from very bad and emotionless (like Alfie Allen) to decent acting (like Willem Dafoe))), Good Story (Though it is filled with cliches of an ex-conman coming back into the fold, the storytelling and character writing of John Wick is very good to paint him as the ultimate figure to not be messed with), Pretty Bad to Decent Screenplay (The dialogue was very bland but there were some good moments), Score was just present (but did help in the action scenes when present), Good Cinematography, Good to Very Good Sound, Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Especially, when showing the firefights), Good Costumes (Even though it is just a suit, they really helped create an iconic character in John Wick), Plot Structure was decent for the most part (but does follow a typical action-movie one), Pacing was incredible fast to where the runtime was very short (But this helps in giving pace to the character of John Wick), Build to climax was prevalent and noticeable in its prep for the action; climax was well executed and a fun part of the movie, Tone of the movie was very dark and grungy (adds to that John Wick feel); but there is a lot of dryness from the deadpan that it kinda takes away from this, The action scenes of the movie were some of the best choreographed action scenes I have ever seen as it is just so physical and technical that it keeps the audience engaged and wanting more. Overall, a movie that is not so great in its own right with its lackluster direction, acting, and screenplay, but is an enjoyable watch because of its intense action scenes and character writing of John Wick (painting a character that will be fun to see what happens next to him).",2014,08/21/2022,290,tt2911666

Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Good from Mark Hamill (A real step back in this performance as he is more reserved and over-the-top (which makes sense given he is now a Jedi), and really is not able to capture the same charm he had in the first two films (even when it is warranted)), Very Good from Harrison Ford (The only one of the main cast who does not have that far back of a drop-off in his performance as he really has to play to his instincts/experience from the character to give this performance (which shows some drop off but is nonetheless the charismatic star of the show)), Decent from Carrie Fisher (Really took a step back in her performance as she reverts to someone who is not able to keep up with the cast (with the lack of inflection and big pauses in delivery)), Pretty Good from Billy Dee Williams (not as much of a presence in this film as he lost the charm that made his character so lovable from the previous film, though still does have some good moments), Pretty Good to Good from Ian McDiarmid (Though limited, he did show why he was the right choice for the emperor), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (Really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (Created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship; and continues to show how loving he is towards his new friends), Great from Frank Oz (Really brought the character of Yoda to life with puppeteering and the vocal performance, though he really does not have that much to work with this time), Very Good from Warwick Davis (also for other Ewoks, a debut role that really helped play to the adorableness of the Ewoks), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast; Very Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (Even though the film switches back to its more linearly story-telling style, the overarching story does do a good job at bringing the trilogy to a close), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue takes a step back from its improvements in the last film as it is very obvious at times where George Lucas wrote the dialogue as it is very unnatural; The overall structure of foreshadowing and symbols is worthy of Star Wars praise (Still with some iconic lines)), Brilliant Score (Continues to take what was great from the previous film and adds some new themes that really make this score stand out as well), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Which really stands out in the Luke vs. Vader scene), Great Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life), Very Good to Great Editing, Pretty Bad to Decent Visual Effects (While there are some monumental moments, there is a wide use of bad Green Screen (which was easy to see) and an excessive use of pyrotechnics (to where it just got annoying); there are also many flaws from the new edition that were so painful to watch (example being the Jabba's palace scenes)), Incredible to Brilliant Production Design (Some of the best sets in all of Star Wars that are so iconic and well remembered in history, with the Tatooine/Endor sets being some of my favorite from the series), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context; also, the ewok costumes were so adorable in how they were designed to where it added to us caring about them), Plot Structure went back to the linear structure but does a good job in setting pieces together and making sure everything comes together in the end, Pacing was good and not too rushed or slow, Build to climax was good as it helped build the relationships between the different characters (Luke and Vader as well as Han and Leia); Climax was a bit anticlimactic (as even though they went for luke to be the better man, it just did not have the flare that the previous movies had as it was meant more for closure in the characters rather than entertainment), Tone goes back to being a mix of a space opera/science fiction epic as the movie really acts as the final act in the saga (needing the other two movie's support to keep it going), As a movie meant to close out the saga it does a good job in bringing closure to character arcs and stories (but this movie cannot really be a stand alone film). Overall, a step back from the previous Star Wars films by reverting back similar bad habits (with George Lucas's poor dialogue and over use of effects), but the movie does do a good job in ending the saga with its world-building and great storytelling (something that makes the Original Trilogy one of the most respected in movie history).",1983,08/28/2022,291,tt0086190

Overall, an iconic family movie that captures the hearts of its audiences through its titular character and the character's plight of trying to make his way back home, taking the audience on an emotional adventure that is guided with Spielberg's incredible direction, groundbreaking cinematography, and iconic John Williams Score.",1982,09/03/2022,292,tt0083866

Overall, a great conclusion to the trilogy as it helps tie loose ends and bring the story to a close in an epic fashion, but the movie is very story dense (that could have been a bit tighter) that needs to seen as a continuation of the previous films rather than being a stand-alone film.",2003,11/30/2022,300,tt0167260

Overall, a movie that does not have that many bells and whistles (and therefore could have probably been better as a play) as it uses a very well written screenplay with experienced actors (that have great chemistry with the director) to make the movie a memorable and fun watch (as it helps blend comedic themes with more depressing, lonely ones).",2022,12/04/2022,302,tt11813216

Overall, a movie that at the surface plays very well for children as it follows the iconic Puss in Boots on his adventure, but overall has a much stronger and deeper meaning of living life without fear and anxiety as the creators synergized incredible animation with great writing to make this movie a must watch.",2022,01/13/2023,312,tt3915174

Overall, a sequel that is pretty on par with the first as it takes many aspects (like the overall who-done-it style for a cast of flawed characters) while still trying to be different (like giving it more of a Summer feel), but does not live up entirely as the story construction (especially the retelling of the story) and topical nature of the movie (bringing up COVID) holds it back a bit.",2022,01/16/2023,313,tt11564570

Overall, a masterclass in subtlety as the direction mixed with Blanchett's performance drives forward a very intense movie without doing/saying that much, but the film's potential is ultimately held back by its long runtime and poor plot construction (which is a shame because these reasons will limit its staying power in film history).",2022,02/02/2023,316,tt14444726

All Quiet on the Western Front,8.3,"Good to Very Good Direction (Did a great job in the macro scenes as he was able to capture the horrors of war through well choreographed battle scenes, also is able to use storytelling and tone to help build scenes and show the message; direction took a hit in more of the interpersonal scenes/negotiation scenes as they are not on the same level as the more important scenes), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good from Felix Kammerer (Does a good job in holding his own as the transitions from the hopefully kid to someone shell-shocked by the fears of War helps with displaying the message), Good from Albrecht Schuch (Plays the companion character very well and plays off of Kammerer very well), Pretty Good from Daniel Brühl (Really is not given that much to work with but does hold his own well), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (When the story stays true to the source material, the movie is very good as it shows the horrors of war and how the trauma effects the soldiers, but the armistice scenes were really pointless as they were not from the source material and really do not add that much to the message at all; also the interpersonal scenes were hit or miss as some really helped add to caring about the characters while some were just not that well executed; the falling action really is a bit too long and could have been cut to make the movie way more tighter as it does not add too much to the story), Good to Very Good Screenplay (Dialogue overall flows pretty nicely with no major issues (hard to tell considering it was a translation); symbolism is prevalent as it helps aid with the the machinery of war as well as the trauma the people face; foreshadowing is pretty obvious but this does not hurt too much), Bad Score (Really does not match the scenes it is in and is mixed in way too loud), Very Good to Great Cinematography (Helps with displaying the war), Good to Very Good Sound (The war scenes and gunshots really helped with displaying the war, the issues have to do with mixing the score in), Pretty Good Editing (For the most part the movie has good editing but there were some noticeable editing mistakes), Very Good Visual Effects, Good Production Design (Helped with creating the scene of WWI), Good Makeup (Especially the gore), Very Good Costumes, Plot Structure was a major issue for the movie as it has a main story that it does very well but a side story about the armistice was pointless to where it drew away from the main story and what the overall message of the movie was; the falling action after the announcement of the war ending really could have been cut in half as it really make the movie drag for the final 40 minutes, Pacing was a bit on the slower side as the movie is more of a slower burn (but about 20-30 minutes of the movie could have been cut for plot that does not need to be there), There were multiple climaxes (with all of them being carried out very well to show the fear of war; the actual climax (the final one) was very well shot and helps display the message for the movie, Tone was conveyed very nicely as the historical time-period coupled with the fearful performances by the actor really helped provide a thrilling tone filled with anxietyS, The movie stays pretty true to the source material but added additional scenes that were unnecessary. Overall, a war movie that is very good when staying true to the story as it shows the horrors war has on the soldiers, but is really held back by scenes that were unnecessary (like the armistice and parts of the falling action) to where the movie drags on longer than it needs to be, thus taking away from the overall message..",2022,03/02/2023,322,tt1016150

Overall, a movie that has very well executed horror sequences, but overall feels like it panders more into the splatter genre than actually making a movie as it cares too much about being gory and providing scary moments than having a well structured horror plot because of how bad the writing and plot construction is (with the biggest issue being how the conflict is handled throughout the movie).",2023,03/19/2023,328,tt13345606

Overall, a decent to pretty good watch in this part of the Rocky/Creed franchise as we get to see some unique features in new storytelling and fighting scenes, but the movie does have its issues as it is way shorter than it should've been given the plot really does not build the rising action at all and there is no real tribute/allusions to Rocky himself (which makes it hard for me to really compare this movie to others in the franchise given my bias towards the original movies).",2023,03/21/2023,331,tt11145118

Ferrari)), Good from Ben Affleck (Similar to Matt Damon's performance as it felt he was more pulling from experience than research into the character), Pretty Good to Good from Jason Bateman (Started off a bit rocky but got his footing as the movie went on and got more screen time), Good from Marlon Wayans (Surprisingly my favorite performance of the movie as he acts the most natural and in tune with what is needed from him (it is just a shame he is only in the movie for one scene)), Pretty Good from Chris Messina, Pretty Good from Chris Tucker (Plays the very Chris Tucker esque character (so also just pulls more from experience)), Good from Viola Davis (Really commands the scenes she is in, but is not able to go above and beyond like her other movies because of the material is working with), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (Does a good job in not having too many moving parts as it only has a a week or two time period that they dive really deep into; the story is laid out well; it is pretty obvious how much of this story was fabricated (but they were never really trying to go for a based on a true story film so it gets a pass)), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (The movie does do a decent job at making the vernacular sound very 1980s; the dialogue is kinda over the top at times as it is pretty obvious when the script is going for the commercial or awards scenes shot; the symbolism is a good as it can get for a biopic (like Sonny analyzing Jordan's jump shot); the foreshadowing is surprisingly present and handled well (like the pink shorts for running)), Good Cinematography (Has the feel of a startup-guerilla style documentary at points, but is still polished to that of a big budget movie), Good Sound, Good Editing (Very similar to 80s movies and sports movies of the 80s/90s (like Jerry Maguire)), Good Production Design (Helped give it that 80s vibe), Plot Structure was laid out well as it focuses on a few events and does a really good job at trying to get as much detail from these events as possible, Pacing was incredibly fast (an intentional thing that I really enjoyed) as it mimics the pressure in Nike trying to sign Jordan, Climax was decent to pretty but felt a little over-the-top and more motivational than it needed to be, Tone was very 80s and the movie does do a good job in helping build this with the vernacular/production design/vibes; the movie also has a bit of a startup/business feel with the quick pace and content, I really respect how they never showed Michael Jordan's face of the movie as that would really take away from the real stars (his mother and the people at Nike) and story (how Nike was able to work with the parents to get Jordan to sign); I also really enjoyed how the movie really never took itself too seriously as it felt like the crew wanted to have fun more than win awards. Overall, a very fun watch about the story of how Michael Jordan signed with Nike as the all-star cast really propels the story forward to make this movie very enjoyable, though it really does not go above and beyond in any way as it is a pretty straightforward biopic with cliche writing (which is kinda the point as it felt like this movie wasn't taking itself too seriously as it was just a couple of friends having fun on a project).",2023,04/01/2023,332,tt16419074

Overall, a decent children's movie that does a good job in staying very true to the games and is carried by its voice cast, but is limited by it being mostly a children's movie (with only nostalgia keeping adults interested) and a very short runtime as the hero's journey really cannot develop (along with the relationship between Mario and Peach).",2023,04/10/2023,333,tt6718170

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,8.2,"Very Good Direction (This movie really shows how comfortable Gunn is at guiding ensemble casts through super hero epics as he pulls from experience to drive the story forward; Gunn also really shows his ability to tell a heartbreaking story by weaving past elements to fuel the present), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good from Chris Pratt (Really builds off his experience as the leader of the group as he has his signature charm while showcasing more of his dramatic chops), Pretty Good to Good from Zoe Saldana (Her character is more restricted/rigged this time so she can't really show too much emotion, but she does a good job with what she was given), Pretty Good to Good from Dave Bautista, Pretty Good to Good from Karen Gillan, Good from Pom Klementieff, Good from Vin Diesel, Great from Bradley Cooper (Really shows a range of emotions through this vocal performance and displays why he is the real protagonist of the movie), Pretty Good from Sean Gunn, Decent to Pretty Good from Chukwudi Iwuji (His performance was a bit too over-the-top for me but he definitely shows some good moments (its just he went from 0 to 100 way too often); I also think his character was pretty shallowly written as his backstory/motive is not really addressed that well), Decent to Pretty Good from Will Poulter (He was fine with the role he was given, its just I do not think his character was written that well), Good from Sylvester Stallone (That's because he's Sly Stallone, the man), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (Does a great job at concluding the trilogy by closing up the lose-ends of many of the characters; the overall plot was well written and entertaining to watch (though it could have been cut just a little bit); the Rocket backstory was incredibly touching and really showed the trauma Rocket had to go through throughout his whole life (even though it could be argued it is a bit simple and relies on the cute animal trope (something I am able to move past given how moving it is)); the character writing for the villains was not the best because it really does not go into their backstory (so it makes it harder to believe their plight); the movie still does follow a lot of the same marvel trope that hold it back a bit), Good Screenplay (The dialog feels very similar to other movies in the trilogy as it is witty, funny, and touching; the symbolism of the movie is incredibly profound as it really looks into the effects friendships and family have on people (especially with how rigid Rocket is to opening up, the importance of family for Quill, and why Quill is trying to get Gamora back); the foreshadowing was kind a setback in the movie as it is just pretty predictable overall in how safe they go about the movie (I would have liked it to be a bit more depressing/dark to be more profound); still has very Marvel elements to the screenplay that restrict if from going above and beyond), Good Score/Very Good Soundtrack (while there wasn't a consistent theme as in the other movies, I still liked the song selection (like Creep and Dog Days Are Over)), Very Good Cinematography (Really enjoyed the 360/wide-angle style cinematography in the fight scenes (especially the hallway scene)), Very Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Used CGI very well to help tell the story and make the fights entertaining), Good Production Design, Very Good Makeup, Very Good Costumes, Plot Structure was good for the most part as all the major points were laid out nicely (but there was a bit too much plot that was not that necessary (like 10-15 minutes could have been cut)); the narrative style of weaving between the past and the present was well done as it helped make Rocket a more multidimensional character, Pacing was good for the most part as it stayed a steady pace for most of the movie up until the end (the ending felt incredibly rushed at how abrupt it was (which kinda hurt considering it was meant to wrap up all the storylines for the Guardians)), Climax was entertaining and fun to watch but still showed many signs of following the Marvel formula (though there was some James Gunn touches on it that made it feel somewhat unique), Tone was established very well throughout the movie as it blends the sadder/dramatic parts very well with the more traditional lighthearted/funny moments to show how this installment continues where the previous installments left off while still being unique in its own-right; there still was some signs of it following the Marvel tone, The movie does a good job in helping provide more context to some of the the characters in the previous films (like Rocket) as the backstory presented shows why some of the characters acted in the way they did in the first two installments; this by far was the saddest MCU movie (mainly because of the character writing/backstory of Rocket). Overall, a good end to the trilogy that has become a staple in the MCU as James Gunn uses tone/writing/visual effects to build off his previous comedic movies while also creating what might be the saddest/most touching Marvel movie (mainly through the backstory/writing of Rocket), but the movie does fall under the trap many Marvel movies follow as it is a bit too restricted by the predictable MCU boilerplate to be more profound that it is capable of being.",2023,05/07/2023,342,tt6791350

Overall, a complete miss from one of my favorite comedic actors of the 21st century as he creates a very shallow movie with no substance as the script and direction really do not play into his strengths at all, making the movie not funny or profound in any way (making you wonder how this project even got green light).",2023,05/12/2023,343,tt9013340

Overall, a pretty good superhero movie as the more micro elements of the movie coupled with the playful tone made the film a fun watch and engaging overall (especially the dual role of Ezra Miller and Michael Keaton returning as Batman), but the overuse of CGI and the pretty predictable plot makes this movie a bit too late in the race to the Multiverse.",2023,06/01/2023,347,tt0439572

the attention to detail in the micro scenes were also nice to see), Good to Very Good Voice Acting (Good from Shameik Moore (Has a very similar performance as the first one, embodies the role of a young Spider-Man navigating different pressures in life), Very Good from Hailee Steinfeld (Builds off the last performance very well as she shows more dimensions to the character and really steals the scenes she is in), Very Good from Brian Tyree Henry (Continues to give a multi-dimensional vocal performance here as he shows the angry and loving side of being a father; also does a good job in playing the comedic relief in the scenes he is in), Very Good from Luna Lauren Vélez (The biggest improvement from the previous film as she shows so many emotions to display a caring mother who really wants what is best for her son (even if that means letting him go)), Good to Very Good from Jake Johnson (Shows a bit more range this time around as the element of being a father allows him to be more empathetic to Miles), Good from Jason Schwartzman (Not too much a menacing villian but does a good job in the scenes he is in), Good to Very Good from Issa Rae (The force she is in the movie is really displayed through this vocal performance as we how important she is to the Spider-Force), Good to Very Good from Karan Soni (Really embodies an Indian Spider-Man very well), Very Good from Daniel Kaluuya (Steals the scenes he is in as he has somewhat of a loving tension between him and Miles, Kaluuya also seems like he is just pooling from his experience being a British actor), Very Good to Great from Oscar Isaac (The real menacing force of the movie and the true foil for Miles, steals the scenes he is in by showing why he does what he does), Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (Really builds from the last movie as they steer away from the template that made the last movie predictable and showed more about Mile's importance in the Spider-Verse; the darker elements of the movie were also great to see included as it shows both the good and the bad of being a Spider-Man (especially about the parallelism in timelines); there are many iconic elements of the story that will eventually be told in pop-culture (like Canon events)), Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue this time was more powerful and profound in its meaning as it really touched on the ideas of purpose and growing up; Jokes not as funny this time (which is kinda byproduct of it being more of a serious movie); The symbolism really improves this time around as it is way more evident and really helps in showing the meaning/message of the movie (also the easter eggs were also really nice to see as they help tie the worlds together/are nice things to see); the foreshadowing was an integral part of the movie as it helped show the parallelism between the different worlds and how some events were predictable (also the small details act as important elements for how the story unfolds later on in the movie)), Incredible Score (Builds on an already great score form the first movie as it keeps all the good themes from the first movie while adding new genres to shows the personalities of all the different characters; used very well to help build suspense (especially during the beginning and end with Gwen))/Good Soundtrack (was fine but just not as many hits as the first movie), Great Sound (especially during the fight scenes), Incredible to Brilliant Editing (Really build on the last movie as it brought all the worlds together while still keeping that comic book feel as the first movie; the editing strengths were shown very well in the fighting scenes as it helps bring together all this small elements in the macro sized scenes), Brilliant Visual Effects/Animation (Builds off the revolutionary 2D animation style they used in the first movie as they use different animation styles to help give character to the different worlds (with the Gwen world being the most visually appealing through the use of colors); again is used well to help tell the story with the different visual text elements; the animation of the fighting scenes were also stunning as they really showed their full capability in making such beautiful worlds), Plot Structure was kinda the biggest fault of this movie just because of the nature of the movie (the movie is one of two parts so its a constant build to a cliffhanger), Pacing was a bit on the slower side (though a better pace than the last movie) as it seems the directors wanted to use the fact that this movie is one of two parts to help build the scenes well without being too fast; Runtime was fine (given this movie is one of two parts, I feel like they used the runtime well to build everything up to a point where you are leaving wanting more), Climax was incredible as it was incredibly suspenseful and shows some of the hidden messages of the movie; the movie leaves off in the middle of the climax (creating this cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more), Tone was a bit more darker this time (though the beginning is pretty similar to the first movie) as it helps show how Miles has to prove himself in the universe and how he needs to navigate the pressures of being Spider-Man while also growing up, The Indian representation of this movie was a Chef's kiss as it was nice to finally see the largest populated country in the world portrayed in one of the franchises in Pop-Culture (and in a good way as well). Overall, another groundbreaking film in the franchise that only builds on everything they created in the previous film as the brilliant animation and incredible writing is used to show the audience a well-rounded story about a Spider-Man who is trying to find his place in the world, with the only major drawback of the movie being that it suffers from the flaws of it being one of two parts.",2023,06/03/2023,349,tt9362722
