Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,7.9,"REDUX 09/04/22: Good to Very Good Direction (Able to move the story forward (though in a more cautious manner) and execute the action scenes very well; also does a pretty good job in getting the most of out his actors (though they are limited throughout the movie)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Felicity Jones (Able to command all the scenes she is in and be a very vocal leader with her cast and during the action scenes, though she does some limitations when it comes to the more powerful scenes), Good from Diego Luna (Able to hold his own for a majority of the movie and does well in the more action-packed scenes, but he shows his ceiling in many of the dramatic scenes), Very Good from Ben Mendelsohn (Able to play the villain role very well and shows range throughout the movie in being that menacing figure wanting more power), Great from Alan Tudyk (Really steals the show with his performance as he plays the smart-witted/comedic relief character), Decent from Forest Whitaker (Very over-the-top in his performance but does a good job in commanding the scenes he is in), Pretty Good to Good from Riz Ahmed (Plays the anxious character well but does show a bit of inexperience to where his character is not that believable), Decent from James Earl Jones (Something just feels very off from his performance (probably from the age), but he does do a good job in making Vader feel like a menacing presence), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (Just typical Star Wars level acting))), Very Good to Great Story (The architecture of the story is very well laid out and entertaining (even though there are massive deviations from the traditional storytelling), though the storytelling is a bit on the safer side and not as ambitious as other Star Wars movies; the story also does try to jam a lot into it and this takes away from building some of the side characters and their relationships to the story), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (While there were some iconic lines, a lot of this movie is filled with corny dialogue meant to build power (but just ends up being a bit more laughable); The character writing for some of the characters were really good but they introduce so many characters that it just waters down all the new introductions; the foreshadowing, symbolism, and allusions to A New Hope were very well executed as it helps paint a more holistic picture of the first Star Wars movie (especially painting the rebellion to be a bit more on the darker side)), Very Good to Great Score (Helps keep that Star Wars feel while adding new themes to the universe), Great Cinematography, Incredible Sound, Incredible Editing, Great to Incredible Visual Effects (Everything from this movie was incredible but the Deepfakes did show their age as it falls more into the uncanny valley now), Very Good Production Design, Very Good Makeup, Great Costumes (Helps pay homage to A New Hope's costumes), Plot Structure was very well executed from a macro level as it helps entertain the audience but there is a lot jammed into the movie that it takes away from helping build the characters and their importance (they are kinda just plopped into the story), Pacing was a bit on the faster side cause of how much they try to jam (if they cut like cut 30 minutes of new content/characters and used it to slow the pace and build up some of their characters the movie would have a bit better execution), Build to climax was very well done and is a bit similar to other blockbuster/Star Wars movies; climax was incredibly executed and the best part of the movie (whether it be from the fights on the ground or the fire fights), Tone of the movie is very similar to other Star Wars movies but the movie does have a bit of a unique feel that is separate, The movie does a great job in displaying fan service as it does a good job in showing the importance and elements of the original film (whether it be the allusions or the ending scene that is jaw-dropping in its execution). Overall, an entertaining movie that helps rejuvenate the Star Wars franchise through its well executed action scenes and fan-service to the original film, though it is filled with corny dialogue and introduction of too many new elements that it is not able to be on the same par as the original trilogy. ORIGINAL (8.5, 01/06/2017): Final Third of the movie was amazing, great action, great plot, has a gradual progression from slow to fast pace, not a memorable cast due to the fact that they all die.",2016.0,09/04/2022,1.0,tt3748528

La La Land,9.6,"REDUX 03/28/2023: Incredible to Brilliant Direction (Really does an amazing job in building this modern world filled with nostalgic pieces of old Hollywood; truly blends in different elements of story and acting help tell an iconic tale that highlights the golden era of Hollywood; the movie on a macro scale is phenomenal as it builds these lush sets for the music numbers, is also great at a micro scale as it helps build the dreams fo the two leads), Very Good to Great Acting (Great from Ryan Gosling (Does a great job in playing off of Emma Stone very well and also being this relic of old hollywood that is initially resistent to change, but changes over time the more he opens himself up to Mia), Great from Emma Stone (The real star of the show as she does a great job in being the hopeful actress who is starting to doubt herself; she really plays off of Gosling well as their chemistry is what really drives both of their performances (and the movie) forward), Very Good from the rest of the cast), Brilliant Story (The parallelism then divergence of both the leads in their dreams and their relationship really brought a sense of realism to what could actually happen (even in a fantasy world); everything that happened in the story of this movie I would not change as it is near perfect on so many accounts; in terms of an actual narrative structure, is is laid out very well with all the different elements of the plot labeled very nicely (in a way that mimics old hollywood)), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (The dialogue is just very natural yet has flavors of old hollywood; the symbolism is in incredible as it really helps with showing the meanings of the movie in terms of aspirations and love; the foreshadowing is some of the best I have ever seen in a movie as there are small symbols that are subtle touches that come out towards the end of the movie), Brilliant Score/Brillaint Soundtrack (My favorite use of music in a movie as it is weaved so perfectly into the film to build emotion and tone), Great Cinematography, Great Sound (Helps in giving it that Jazzy, old hollywood feel), Great Editing, Incredible Production Design (Helps in building the feel and tone of the movie), Very Good Costumes (More just about the dresses than the costumes in general, the strong colors really help in making the movie playful), Plot Structure is laid out perfectly as it does not say too far in any moment of the narrative arc; all the different elements are established very well (which kinda helps with the transition slides in the movie), Pacing was a consistent pace nothing feels like it is rushing or dragging (runtime is perfect as it is), Climax was very good as it is a climax in the main narrative of the movie; it is the resolution that is the best part of the movie as it shows the true message of the movie and what would actually happen (with it being executed so well), Tone was established very well as it is a very old hollywood/musical feel as many elements of the movie (production design, screenplay, music, sound, etc.) really come together to help give this feel. Overall, an Incredible movie that really is a strong homage to old Hollywood as almost all of the elements come together to tell this realistic dream of what may happen to those who chase their dreams in Hollywood, with the Direction, Writing, Score, and Production Design being major highlights in making this movie a modern classic.

The Other Guys,9.4,"REDUX 04/09/2022: Very Good Direction (Was able to blend the comedic and action elements very well), Good to Very Good Acting (Incredible from Will Ferrell (Incredible Chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlburg as both actors' strengths come out when working off each other), Incredible from Mark Wahlberg (See Will Ferrell), Great from Michael Keaton (Really steals the show in his over-the-top nature), Good from Steve Coogan, Good to Very Good from Samuel L. Jackson (In his very brief roles), Good to Very Good from Dwayne Johnson (In his very brief roles), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (At its core, the movie is pretty surface level in that cops are trying to make a break for themselves, but the typical Adam McKay and Will Ferrell story elements really make different elements of the story funny), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (One of the funniest movies I have watched due to the quotable jokes and how stereotypical of a Will Ferrell movie this is), Good Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Pretty Good Visual Effects, Plot Structure was very nice and laid out well, Pacing was good as it kept a consistent pace (with no scenes really needed to be cut, but some of the deleted scenes were very funny), Build to climax was very typical of movies from this time (so pretty good); climax was good (A generic mix of 2000s action with comedic elements), Tone was set very nicely as it followed the action comedy template very nicely. Overall, an incredibly funny movie that is incredibly quotable and a must watch for the jokes and the chemistry between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlburg as it is a pillar in the buddy cop genre that began to take over the early 2010s.

The Dark Knight,9.9,"REDUX 10/01/2023: Brilliant Direction (Brilliant from both a macro and a micro point of view as he really controls every scene and drives the narrative forward through multiple elements (but mostly uses the rich writing to tell the story); got the most out of the main cast of actors as he controls every scene and has them work with each other to move the story forward; is not crazy with his signature Nolan style as goes as far as a comic book interpretation can take him (which is farther than most comic book movies)),  Acting (Incredible from Christian Bale (Really controls the show and gives a wide range of emotions as he uses the experience he gained from the last movie to really show an unselfish multi-dimensional character), Great from Michael Caine (Acts as the perfect scene partner to Bale as he is the moral truth/father figure that Bruce Wayne needs during his time of crisis in this movie), Brilliant from Heath Ledger (The best performance I have ever seen as he steals the show in every scene he is in and does a brilliant job at eliciting fear from not only the audience but the actors he is working with too; the different sides of the Joker are also displayed as he makes you feel for him despite not knowing anything about him (or what is even true)), Great from Gary Oldman (Really embodies the role of Gordon through demeanor and experience, working well off of Batman to help save Gotham), Very Good from Aaron Eckhart (Does a very good job as you can see the biggest shift in his character from someone hopeful to someone who is hopeless and has nothing (though is a bit over-the-top at times)), Good to Very Good from Maggie Gyllenhaal (An upgrade from Katie Holmes as she does a good job at working off of the other cast mates, but does not have the strong chemistry that other characters have with each other (and is not super believable as the female lead as well)), Very Good from Morgan Freeman (Plays the typical Morgan Freeman role very well), Good from the rest of the cast (It is more of a spectrum as some of the extras were pretty bad but overall it was good from the rest of the cast)), Brilliant Story (One of the best laid-out stories ever as it uses some influence from the comic books to help architect such a unique story that is something more than a Comic Book movie, a movie that is about sacrifice and being something greater than yourself; the story points build off each other throughout the movie as the different story arcs for all the characters progress throughout the movie until the very end), Brilliant Screenplay (The dialogue is just perfect as everything flows and it is just filled with so many iconic lines; the jokes (while few) do hit and help lighten the mood; the symbolism is brilliant as the themes of Chaos and Sacrifice play vital roles in the decisions of the characters; the foreshadowing is brilliant as most of the movie is about Batman trying to come to terms with what he knows he has to do), Brilliant Score (One of my favorite scores ever as it is used to provide background into the characters, invoke emotions, and drive the tempo of the movie), Incredible Cinematography (Really uses the IMAX cameras and the film well as it shows the grandeur of some of the shows and helps give insight in the scale of the movie (with this best being shown in the opening sequence)), Incredible Sound (A small aspect of the movie but is just so memorable as this mixed with the score helps show tension and anxiety in some of the action scenes (like the Joker Motorcycle scene)), Incredible Editing (Just really pieces this movie together and helps show the different angles the characters are seeing and different emotions they are feeling (whether it be lost by slowing down the movie or anxious when it is sped up/cut fast)), Incredible Visual Effects (The use of practical effects helps with showing how possible Batman could be, and the use of Pyro shows the simplicity of the Joker's regime), Great Production Design (Some iconic sets such as the Bat Bunker show the makeshift approach he has to after he lost Wayne Manor and the Bat Cave), Incredible Makeup (Mostly the Joker's Makeup and Two-Face as it helps paint how menacing the characters are (even with the simplicity of the former)), Incredible Costumes (Mostly just the Bat suit and the Joker suit with how iconic they are), Plot Structure was laid out perfectly as each story element builds on itself as the movie goes through the narrative up until its climax; the movie feels like it hits a point where everything shifts and a second movie comes out to show how chaotic Gotham becomes, Pacing is on the quicker side but the movie does an amazing job speeding up the tempo to show an anxiety rush or slowing it down to show the loss and depression some of the characters feel, Climax is executed perfectly as it was built up incredibly and can be seen from two perspectives (both the hero's and the villain's side) as we get to see who really wins and what needs to happen, Tone had a comic book feel but also a mystery-thriller feel (but ultimately a Christopher Nolan feel in the end), There is some bias with this movie because Christopher Nolan is my favorite director and this movie has so much personal meaning to me (being from Chicago and hearing about the filming from my Mom as she went to work). Overall, a magnum opus in cinema since everything is nearly perfect as we see Christopher Nolan take a comic book source material and go beyond what is possible as he spins it into a movie about Chaos, Loss, and Sacrifice, something that is driven forward and provoked by Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance.

Spider-Man,8.5,"REDUX 04/18/2024: Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is very good as builds this comic-book version of New York City and has memorable action sequences; the direction on a microscale is incredibly campy and 00s (but this helps make the movie enjoyable and memeable); the direction of actors is pretty bad as a lot of the performances feel overly campy and unnatural; the storytelling is very good as it feels very focused and structured, and Raimi does a good job in showing the origin of Spider-Man and how duty affects his decisions; he builds tension pretty well, as much as he can for a PG comic book movie), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Decent to Pretty Good from Tobey Maguire (Incredibly campy and monotonous when he is Peter Parker, but he does hold his own well as Spider-Man; despite its surface-level flaws, his performance is just so memorable and iconic that it helps add to why people love this movie), Good from Willem Dafoe (I love how over-the-top and iconic this performance is as he does a good job at showing the two sides of Norman and how he can switch so seamlessly; has very good line delivery in the more iconic moments), Decent from Kirsten Dunst (A pretty shallow performance that does not have any chemistry with her castmates, but nothing is not a problem as she holds her own well)), Pretty Bad from James Franco (He does not connect with any of his classmates and his levels are just very off compared to the rest of the cast), Pretty Good from Cliff Robertson (Plays the fatherly figure well as he helps establish Peter's moral compass), Decent to Pretty Good from Rosemary Harris (Plays the motherly figure well and has some good comedic moments), Very Good from J. K. Simmons (By far the best performance of the movie as he is very true to the character and is the funniest character in the movie), Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (So many campy, 2000s background performances)), Great Story (The concept is great as they do an amazing job at creating Spider-Man's backstory and how he establishes his obligation to help others because of his power, and they do a good job at showing how the Green Goblin is tempting him to fight for evil; the plot structure is laid out very well as it feels like every scene is integral to moving both the movie and Spider-Man's backstory, but it is not perfect because there are issues with how they deal with the passage of time; flow between sequences is pretty standard for a campy comic book movie; character writing is very good as the whole movie is about Peter finding his purpose in life and fulfilling the obligations he has because of his powers, and the Green Goblin acts as a good foil to this because he shows the volatility in public opinions on their heroes (so why even bother)), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue is incredibly campy and 00s, but I do love this because it is filled with iconic lines and is just funny to see how unnatural it is; the humor is pretty good, but the movie is more unintentionally funny than when it tries to be funny; the symbolism is pretty prevalent as the movie is about duty despite living in a corrupted world; the foreshadowing is as good as any other comic book movie, so it kinda makes the movie predictable), Great Score (Very iconic), Good Editing (Incredibly 00s and is very campy, but still enjoyable), Good Sound (Made the web-shooting and the Green Goblin sound iconic), Good Visual Effects (Very 2000s, but still good for the time), Good Production Design (Iconic and helped set this comic book version of New York), Great Costumes (The Spider-Man and Green Goblin suits are some of the most iconic costumes not only in comic book history but film history), Pacing is good as the movie does not feel too fast or too slow, Climax is executed well because is action-packed and shows Spider-Man's decision making, Tone is very 2000s and campy (but this helps make the movie iconic), This is a minor detail but why does everyone call her 'Aunt May' (like I get MJ, but like why does Norman call her 'Aunt May'). Overall, an iconic superhero movie that holds up well with its story and memeable moments as it ushered in the super-hero renaissance of the 21st century, even though it is very 00s and campy. ORIGINAL (8.5, 05/21/2017): Iconic, great story, Decent acting, plot holes in how he became a good fighter, a childhood movie favorite, good screenplay, plays emotions pretty well, good action.",2002.0,04/18/2024,22.0,tt0145487
Inglourious Basterds,9.6,"REDUX 09/22/2023: Brilliant Direction (The best use of subtly to build tension I have ever seen in a movie as he does so much to build suspense throughout the movie with so little; the macro-scenes are incredibly executed and the micro-scenes are done very well as the acting feels so natural between the cast (especially in the opening scene and the bar scene); moves the story incredibly well as he uses the chapter format to begin story arcs and build each piece on each other up until the climax), Great Acting (Good to Very Good from Brad Pitt (A very over-the-top performance that helps bring a comedic element to the movie), Brilliant from Christoph Waltz (He can switch between motions so fast and effortlessly as he can switch between humor and hour in a snap; he also commands all the scenes he is in with his menacing figure, and he uses different languages to help be very persuasive in the scenes he is in), Very Good from Michael Fassbender (Holds his own very well in his scenes and does a good job in working with his cast to progress the story forward), Good from Eli Roth, Great from Diane Kruger (Really steals the scenes she is in and has somewhat of a duel personality as she works with both sides of the war), Very Good from Daniel Brühl, Good from Til Schweiger, Great from Mélanie Laurent (Does an amazing job in helping build empathy with her struggle as her disdain towards the Reich and cool persona make her somewhat of a neo-action star), Good from B. J. Novak, Good from the rest of the cast (Not a single bad performance turned in as everyone works well with each other as the acting helps make the scenes so captivating)), Incredible Story (Uses the chapter format very well to help break up the movie into smaller pieces that build on each other as we get to see different perspectives from the war and how they converge to the climax; each chapter is also very captivating as they can be real short stories on their own with how well written and captivating they are (especially the opening and bar scene); the character writing (especially for Hans Landa) is incredible as he creates very memorable icons through the use of nicknames and actions they do; the foreshadowing of the movie is pretty prominent because the movie at the end of the day is a revenge story; there is also a lot of symmetry throughout the movie), Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue is just so iconic and memorable as it flows effortlessly between the characters and has iconic lines throughout; the jokes were very typical to other Tarantino movies (so funny and helps move the story forward); the symbolism is very present), Great Cinematography (Does a good job in helping build the suspense of scenes), Great Sound (Does its part in helping build suspense and be a part of the action scenes), Great Editing, Good Visual Effects, Great Production Design (Helps with setting the period), Plot Structure was very similar to Pulp Fiction in that the movie was split into chapters (and this a very good design as it helps break up the long runtime into a smaller movie as each chapter builds on each other as they all converge to the climax), Pacing was good as the movie really changed its tempo based on the scenes (it was quick when trying to progress through scenes but slow when trying to build suspense), Climax was executed very well as it was very Tarantino is style and was a very captivating part to see all the storylines converge to one point, Tone was similar to WWII themed movies but felt very similar to other Tarantino movies in feel and style; there never really felt like just a thriller or a comedy, There wasn't really a score but the soundtrack was used very well to help build suspense throughout the movie; one of the best-executed uses of using tension to help build suspense I have ever seen in movies. Overall, a true masterclass in building suspense as we see Tarantino take control and mature as a filmmaker through his brilliant direction and incredible writing, with this this been taken control of on-screen through Christoph Waltz's brilliant performance as the menacing Hans Landa.

Overall, my favorite pure sports movie as this incredible underdog story uses writing, acting, and score to help make the audience feel invested in the team's journey, though its tone and historical inaccuracies hold it back from being incredible. ORIGINAL (9.4, 06/13/2017): Great Acting, Great Story, Great Screenplay but some lines are questionable, Great Score, Very Relatable Movie, Great Job exploring the demons of every character and how almost everyone has something to prove, Ending was kinda out of place.",2011.0,08/15/2023,28.0,tt1210166
Good Will Hunting,9.6,"REDUX 08/15/2023: Great Direction (Nothing is above and beyond but he does a great job in moving the story forward (uses the writing to mostly tell the story) as he uses a decently lighthearted storytelling style to help you care about the characters; gets a lot out of the actors in the interpersonal scenes as the conversations they have really make the movie captivating), Great Acting (Incredible from Robin Williams (The best performance of the movie as he uses both his dramatic and comedic abilities to create a very well-rounded character that acts as the father-figure Will never had), Incredible from Matt Damon (The most dynamic character of the movie as he drives the story forward with his charm and line delivery (mainly because wrote the script)), Very Good from Ben Affleck (Plays the complement to Damon very well as their chemistry makes their on-screen relationship very believable), Very Good from Stellan Skarsgård (Works well in his scenes with Williams and Damon as it is very obvious to see when his ego is checked and how much change he has throughout the movie), Good to Very Good from Minnie Driver (Plays the female lead well (but feels like kinda out of place given who the rest of the cast is)), Very Good from the rest of the cast (All play their part well as it helps with setting the tone and the place of Boston (especially Southie))), Brilliant Story (A very iconic story that is laid out brilliantly as the directing, performances, and dialogue drive this story forward into being one of the best ever told on the big screen; the story elements build off of each other as each part has its purpose as the ending shows what it was building to the entire time; the character development is great as well as the movie is really about that and it delivers (for more than just one)), Brilliant Screenplay (The best screenplay I have ever seen as the dialogue is so tight/sharp as it is filled with many callbacks and allusions to help drive the story and the message forward; the wit and humor make this movie as it gives it that working-class edge that sets Will and his gang apart from the establishment characters; the symbolism is great as it really helps with showing the message of the movie (Will's genius vs his development); the foreshadowing is prominent as it shows at what they were trying to build the entire time), Very Good Score (Pretty safe overall but complements the emotions of the scenes very well), Good Cinematography (Good for a low-budget movie), Pretty Good Sound, Very Good Editing (Especially for how low-budget the movie is, helps with driving the story forward), Plot Structure was laid out incredibly well as the different narrative elements are shown and each individual story element helps with move the movie forward (with the climax and resolution helping with showing the message), Pacing was a bit on the slower side (though this was not a terrible issue) as it felt like this movie wanted to use as much time as it could to have scenes that show off the characters and their personalities; Runtime should be kept the same as there really is no scene I would want to cut, Climax was executed very well and helps with showing how far Will has come on his journey (and finding out what he wants to do with his life), Tone was very feel-good as this light-hearted tone helps with making the audience love the characters more and making the drama overall feel very fun. Overall, the best-written movie I have ever seen as this iconic film stands the test of time to show how EQ is just as important as IQ as we go on a journey through Will Hunting's journey, driven by great direction and performances along with its superb writing.

Deadpool,9.1,"REDUX 07/23/2024: Very Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is very good as it interjects meta humor into traditional comic-book action sequences, and they do a good job laying the groundwork for this movie to be a meta-satire; the direction on a microscale is very good as these scenes really bring out the meta humor and the characters/relationships; the storytelling is very good as they do a good job jumping from past to present to provide an origin story while also showing how far Deadpool has come on his journey), Great Story (The concept is very unique, as it is a meta-comedy based on an often-overlooked superhero, creating a narrative that really plays to his strengths; the plot structure is unique, as it uses the first half to jump back and forth between the past and the present to set Deadpool's origin story, and after this halfway point, it jumps into the climax; the character writing is very good, as they stay really faithful to the comics in creating Deadpool), Great Screenplay (The dialogue is really good, as it is filled with metacomedy/fourth-wall breaking, and helps make the movie funny and enjoyable; the humor makes this movie one of the funniest superhero movies ever, pushing boundaries that others have never gone; the foreshadowing is good, as it uses cliches, but borderline parodies them simultaneously), Pretty Good Acting (Very Good from Ryan Reynolds (Perfectly embodies the role as it feels like he is Deadpool, from his comedic mannerisms to his meta forthwall breaking), Good from Morena Baccarin (A good love interest and has great chemistry with Reynolds), Pretty Good from Ed Skrein (Pretty Good Villian), Pretty Good to Good from T. J. Miller (Pretty Good side-kick to Deadpool), Decent from Gina Carano (Really isn't given that many lines but plays her part well in the fighting scenes), Pretty Good from Brianna Hildebrand (Plays the teenager role well), Pretty Good from Karan Soni (His Indian comedic relief really has a part in the comedy as it helps juxtapose the bad-ass nature of Deadpool), Decent from the rest of the cast (Nobody feels really outstanding but everyone plays their part)), Pretty Good Score, Pretty Good Soundtrack, Good Cinematography (Used well to give the action sequences personality), Very Good Editing (Feels very crisp and helps make this movie feel unique), Very Good Sound, Good Visual Effects (A bit dated, but fine for the times), Very Good Costumes (Deadpool's costume is very iconic, as it stays really true to the comic books), Pacing is good, as it slows down the pace in the right moments to interject comedy, Climax is a typical superhero climax (mixed with comedic moments), Tone is very metacomedy mixed with a superhero movie, making it uniquely Deadpool. Overall, a unique superhero movie that plays to the strengths of Ryan Reynolds by using metacomedy and fourth-wall breaking mixed with action to be true to Deadpool.

Overall, an entertaining movie with iconic elements like its writing and performances (especially Rachel McAdams), but feels like it is held back by its ending and style as it reeks of the 00s teen movie genre.

Overall, a good movie that uses its very good cast and unique fourth-wall breaking, meta humor to explain the 2008 housing crisis, but its style makes it hard nauseating to watch at some points and the ending feels very forced and preachy.

Overall, a must watch as Aronofsky puts himself on the mainstream map by crafting an incredible insight into the descent people go to fill the void of happiness they have as we get to see 4 characters spiral out of control through their addictions, though it is not a perfect movie as it is filled with many flaws (and but not it being it is nauseating and grotesque).

Overall, a great adaptation to an incredible book as we get to see prominent comedic figures of the time come together to make a great movie about one of the worst movies ever made, paying homage to it in a great way as it is carried out by an incredible performance from James Franco as Tommy Wiseau and great writing to show how the Hollywood business is too competitive.

Hereditary,8.9,"REDUX 04/24/2024: Very Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good as he builds this world well and shows the internal struggle for the protagonist, but it falters when he tries to establish the conflict; the direction on a microscale is great as you see how trauma is effecting these characters (especially the protagonist); the storytelling is good to an extent as you see how trauma is effecting Annie and how she is trying everything she can to try and relieve her pain/guilt, but the storytelling falls apart towards the end when they try to resolve the conflict; he builds tension incredibly well as it uses a lot of horror techniques plus the emotional weight of what is going on to), Good Story (The concept is very interesting as the movie boils down to a mother grieving the loss of her loved ones and going through every possible way to relieve her trauma/pain, but the supernatural concept is kinda forced in and not told well; the plot structure is a real mess as the conflict feels very forced and sudden, which leads to it being poorly executed (this movie would've really benefited from 20 minutes added to learn more about the backstory Annie's mother and how the overarching conflict has been effecting this family); character writing is very good for Annie as you get a sense of who she and how the deaths of everyone around her is effecting her psyche), Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue is very good and natural overall; the symbolism is pretty prominent and helps show what the overarching conflict is; the foreshadowing is very subtle and laced throughout the movie very well, but the main issue is that it is way too subtle that the ending just feels so forced (these are things that are picked up on a second watch but would make no sense on an initial watch)), Very Good Acting (Brilliant from Toni Collette (A perfect encapsulation of a mother grieving on all the loss in her life and how she is doing everything she can to relieve her trauma/pain; a performance that is multi-faceted as she steals the show in both solo shots and group settings), Good from Alex Wolff (Does a good job at playing a high-school teen filled with anxiety and guilt, and he does a good job in showing how the supernatural conflict is affecting him), Good from Milly Shapiro (Does exactly what is needed from her), Good from Ann Dowd (Shows her experience and acts as a conduit for Annie to help her grieve through her loss), Decent from Gabriel Byrne (Has a good number of scenes where his levels don't match the rest of the cast, but comes into his own by the end of the movie), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Most of these characters are minor, but they do what they are told)), Pretty Good Score (Used well to establish tension), Pretty Good Cinematography (Used well for the most part but falls apart towards the end as the motion-blurring/low-budget shooting shows here), Very Good Editing (There were many seamless shots that helped make this movie feel both polished and auter-esque), Very Good Sound (Used effectively to help build tension and illicit fear), Pretty Good Visual Effects (Does the most it can with a small budget), Good Production Design (Really enjoyed the Dollhouse feel for the house as it mimicked Annie's art pieces), Good Makeup (Typical horror makeup), Pacing is good for the most part, but the 45 minutes feel too rushed; 20-30 minutes could have been added leading up to climax, Climax is poorly executed as it feels rushed and forced and feels like a big narrative jump from the rest of the movie, Tone is pretty true to other Supernatural movies (but does a good job at fitting in dramatic/deeper tones throughout the movie), This movie is a lot better on a second watch when you know what the conflict is/how it is built up, but a movie should not require a second watch to fix all the problems from an initial watch. Overall, a very good horror movie that is carried by a brilliant performance from Toni Collete as she perfectly encapsulates a grieving mother and the lengths one would go to relieve her pain/trauma, but a poorly executed climax and a forced conflict hold this movie back from being truly great. While this film is better on a second watch, a movie should not require another viewing to fix major problems from an initial watch.

Overall, the perfect foil to Hereditary as the movie above-the-line executes very well to create a demented pagan story that keeps you on your toes, with the director's cut adding even more depth into this sadistic fever dream.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,9.2,"REDUX 12/29/2023: Great Direction (the direction on a macroscale is grander this time around as there is a higher production budget and the movie makes an effort to show how large New York is in comparison to Kevin; the direction microscale is pretty generic to 80s family comedies; the direction of actors is great as he can bring out the humor and joy in many moments, helps set the lighthearted tone that Kevin brings throughout the movie; storytelling is very similar to other John Hughes movies), Good Acting (Great from Macaulay Culkin (Continues to bring the youthful charm the movie is known for, Great from Joe Pesci (Continues to bring the comedic charm the movie is known for), Very Good from Daniel Stern (Continues to be the good comedic relief partner that plays off of Joe Pesci), Good to Very Good from Tim Curry, Good to Very Good  from Catherine O'Hara, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (The concept is very satirical because the movie makes an effort to show that the story is the same one as the first (just grander); the plot structure follows the same plot structure as the first movie; flow between sequences is like the first in that its the standard John Hughes movie; character writing was very similar to the first movie as it replicates what the characters are going through this time around), Great Screenplay (The dialogue is pretty simple as its a family movie (but it is filled with iconic lines), the movie also uses dialogue to show how this movie is the same as the first; the humor was very good and iconic (also pokes fun at how this is the same movie as the first); the foreshadowing is good as it helps with showing the message of Kevin nothing being afraid), Great Score (Continues one of John Williams's most iconic scores), Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Visual Effects (), Good Production Design (Makes an effort to show how grand and regal all the places Kevin stays at in NYC), Pacing was great as it was a steady pace that used its runtime very nicely, Build to the climax was great as it helped tie loose ends in Kevin's fears of being alone and with the old man; the climax is the most iconic part of the movie as it shows Kevin against the Sticky Bandits as he lays the house out with traps to defend himself and show how he is not afraid anymore, Tone was very similar to other John Hughes movies (mixed with Christmas elements), This movie has more of a nostalgic factor for me because I watched it more as a child. Overall, my favorite Christmas movie as this sequel builds on the iconic elements from the first movie, in a borderline satirical way, to show how Kevin can still outsmart the Sticky Bandits on an even larger scale.

Tenet,7.4,"REDUX 02/24/2024: Pretty Good to Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is incredible as he does an amazing job coordinating the action sequences as is mixes both forwards and backwards motion seamlessly; the direction on a microscale is fine as each interpersonal scene felt like it served its purpose, but it just felt like many of the actors were hitting their limit; the direction of actors is pretty bad as the movie is filled with many monotonous performances with bad line delivery; the storytelling feels like an imitation of 'Inception' with its face-paced, convoluted nature, but this feels like this is done to bypass flaws in the plot; he builds tension very well in the action sequences, but the tension feels kinda forced in the interpersonal sequences because the conflict is not that believable), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Pretty Bad from John David Washington (Very monotonous and hard to believe him as the lead as he hits an obvious limit in many of the interpersonal scenes), Good from Robert Pattinson (Portrays a range of emotions and a lot of charisma as he really steals the show in his scenes with Washington), Pretty Good from Elizabeth Debicki (Shows some range of emotion, but lacks chemistry with Washington), Decent from Dimple Kapadia (Hits a limit in many of her scenes, but does a decent job in playing off of Washington), Pretty Good from Michael Caine (Typical Nolan Michael Caine performance), Pretty Good from Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Shows charisma in his scenes and works off of Washington and Pattinson well), Good from Kenneth Branagh (The only actor (besides Pattinson) that felt like he did his homework as you see him get fully immersed into the role, though there are some questionable over-the-top moments), Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (A lot of monotonous performances that do not support the main cast)), Pretty Bad Story (The concept on a macroscale is pretty interesting with how they tackle reversing entropy and nuclear warfare, but this concept is unnecessarily more convoluted than it needs to be as they do a pretty poor job at explaining the conflict and why its important; the plot structure was kinda an issue because the lack of an exposition makes it hard to believe how much of an impact the conflict is to the world; the flow between sequences is pretty mismanaged because it just feels like many of scenes are just forced together; the character writing is intentionally void as it helps present a sense of mystery on who these people are, but this has an impact on how much your care for the characters because you really don't know what they are fighting for (especially The Protagonist)), Decent Screenplay (The dialogue is pretty bad because none of the lines feel natural or realistic; the humor is pretty typical to other Nolan movies; the symbolism is decent as the movie tackles nuclear warfare and physics/time decently well (but this is presented in a bit more of a convoluted way than it needed to be); the foreshadowing is very good as it helped plant seeds that help make the movie feel very full circle by the time you get to the end), Great Score (The score itself is well written and filled with great pieces that have aged well, but the main issue is that it is not used well in a lot of the scenes as it blares over the dialogue to create forced tension), Great Cinematography (Felt incredibly polished in the action sequences and world build scenes, and was an instrumental part in showing how time was reversed for some of the characters), Very Bad Sound (The sound editing was good, but the sound mixing was terrible because it was so hard to hear what people were saying with how the score and gunshots/explosions were mixed into the film), Great Editing (Did an amazing job in mixing reversed objects with forward moving ones), Incredible Visual Effects (Helps with showing this idea of backward moving elements in a forward moving world, and helps with showing the action sequences (especially in the climax)), Pacing was incredibly fast as it leaves little time for the audience to internalize what is happening on screen, Climax is executed well from a technical sense as it is action-packed, but in a story sense it is very convoluted as you don't really know if they solved the conflict until the very end, Tone is very similar to 'Inception' with its espionage style mixed with physics/time-reversal, This movie really is if we had 'Inception' at home; this movie really suffered from having its post-production in Covid. Overall, an interesting concept that is carried out well on a technical level, but this movie is held back by its monotonous performances and unnecessarily convoluted writing as it ultimately feels like if we had 'Inception' at home. ORIGINAL (8.5, 09/15/2020): Good Direction (Incredible during action scenes and coordinating stunts and introducing scenes but poor during moments of conducting dialogue and the more personal scenes), decent acting (Very good from Robert Pattinson, Pretty good from John David Washington (Very emotionless in the first half though), Kenneth Branagh was pretty good to good but over-the-top at times, and the rest of the cast was bad to pretty bad), Great to Incredible Story and Idea (Though I think the middle chunk of the movie was kinda a waste, and the ideas were not executed that well), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was very stiff and not well executed to show what the ideas of the movie were), Great Cinematography, Incredible Score, Great to Incredible Effects, Bad Sound Mixing but Great Sound editing, Incredible Film Editing to coordinate backwards and forwards movement, The movie is very confusing in the first half but make more sense and come full circle once the halfway point is met, All the action scenes are incredible intense and pulled off very well in terms of the suspense they create (Especially the first scene and the climax), A movie that makes more sense the more you think about it, The pacing was way too fast and this played a major issue in presenting ideas and having dialogue cause it made things very unnatural and made things very confusing, A lot of the concepts on time did not make any sense and time travel is just a subject in film to stay away from overall (Even if you are Christopher Nolan). Overall, this was Christopher Nolan's worst movie (Hard for me to say it as it is) given the fact he is a seasoned director at this point and could not execute a movie of this magnitude off, but it is still a Good movie and would still recommend people to watch.",2020.0,02/24/2024,164.0,tt6723592

Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,7.8,"Continuation of a beloved classic and one of, if not the, greatest comedies of all time. In its sequel, Borat does not have as much of the charm as its original movie did. Very funny at times but very mild or bland or disgusting at others, story was coherent as very politically brown nose against the right, the movie is ultimately propaganda to vote. Sacha Baron Cohen was great, though lost a step from her previous version, Maria Bakalova was good acting but was no where near the level of sidekick as Azamt, Good but safe story, Very good but safe screenplay, Good direction (But misleading editing). Overall, This movie was a good look back into one of the greatest movies of all time but plays it safe and ultimately boils down into a movie urging the audience to vote out the right (making it a very topical movie at the present but something that will not make it a classic like its predecessor). This movie really didn't have to be made and looks like a cash grab on a retired character.",2020.0,10/29/2020,166.0,tt13143964
The Social Dilemma,7.0,"Great Topics that are complex but presented in a very simple manner that makes it easy to digest, Expert testimony of the documentary is very good as it brings in a lot of industry experience and credibility to persuade the audience to change how they view social media and technology, I felt they brushed on topics they should've discussed more (Like mental health), the skits were very poorly written and acted and they really drew away from the message of the documentary as they were very unrealistic, the message of the documentary was a little too pessimistic of what may actually happen. Overall, thought the ideas were very well presented, the skits and ending message really hold this documentary back from making a strong impact on the relationship between social media and society.",2020.0,11/22/2020,167.0,tt11464826

Overall, the Coen brothers give a prime example of why they are some of the best screenwriters in Hollywood as they make a short runtime filled with many memorable, funny moments (even though it may not be as incredible as their other movies), but it does falter towards the end as it is incredibly rushed as it feels like it could've used 15 more minutes to keep up to the pace it had for the majority of the movie.",1996.0,11/22/2020,168.0,tt0116282

Overall, a movie that is very hard to watch in the first 1/3 (both because of imagery, understanding the dialogue, plot, and pace), but once you get past that point, it is an great to incredible piece of art that shows the line between psychological treatment and free will as well as the ability for the redemption of the lost.",1971.0,11/27/2020,169.0,tt0066921

Whiplash,9.7,"REDUX 09/19/2024: Incredible Direction (The direction on a macroscale is incredible as he uses fast editing cuts and pacing to really show the rat-race of striving to be the best, and he does an amazing job using lighting and cinematography to build anxiety and tension; the direction on a microscale is brilliant as the scenes between Simmons and Teller show the complex relationship between the two characters, and how the former gaslights the latter to be the best and pushes beyond a moral boundary to get what he wants; the storytelling is incredible as he uses the ego and mental state of Neiman to really show the confidence he has as a drummer and how he pushes himself in silos to get better and appease both Fletcher and himself; he builds tension brilliantly as he uses lighting and anxiety to really show the intensity and villainy of Fletcher, especially in the music scenes as he pushes and gaslights him into being a good player (which is really up for debate if he actually did it for Neiman's best interests)), Brilliant Story (The concept is brilliant as it is an excellent interpretation of the artist's obsession, showing the moral dilemma on the subject and whether or not it is worth pursuing greatness at the expense of one's sanity; the plot structure is laid out very well; character writing is brilliant, Neiman is a symbol for the naive artist striving to achieve it all, with the rise and fall of his ego accurately portraying his confidence, and Fletcher is one of the best-written characters in cinema with how nuanced he is, being both a villain and someone who pushes Neiman to be better), Brilliant Screenplay (The dialogue is incredible as it is sharp and iconic; the humor is really good as it helps paint the tension and makes Fletcher both evil and hilarious; the symbolism is profound as the movie is about the morality of the obsession of the artist and whether or not it is worth pursuing greatness at the expense of your mental health and Neiman himself is a symbol for the ego of a young adult and how their confidence is easily malleable by their surrounding factors; the foreshadowing is incredible and makes the climax so well executed and an incredible sendoff for the movie and these characters), Great Acting (Very Good from Miles Teller (What is really needed from the character as he subtly shows the change in ego and personality for the character the more he gains and loses confidence;  he has great chemistry with Simmons and shows how he is willing to push himself to be the best), Brilliant from J. K. Simmons (A ferocious and villainous performance that really pushes the movie forward as it crosses many moral boundaries to get what he wants; the way he gaslights and berates his players while simultaneously showing 'compassion and care' is so good that you really don't know if Fletcher is really a villain or not (though he leans more into being one); he has great chemistry with Teller), Good from Paul Reiser (Plays the fatherly figure well and has good chemistry with Teller), Decent from the rest of the cast (Feels like typical low-budget movie supporting cast acting)), Incredible Score (The jazz and drums really give this movie a fast-paced feel that helps increase the intensity of the movie), Incredible Soundtrack (Used in conjunction with the score, instrumental in making the movie iconic, as many of these songs are the ones played by the band), Incredible Cinematography (Uses lighting and angles to really build tension; the fast cuts really help make this movie feel like an anxiety rush), Incredible Editing (The fast cuts really help portray the rat-race in trying to achieve perfection;  this helps increase the anxiety and tension of the movie), Incredible Sound (Helps make the movie feel so polished and interjects music well; it is used to help build tension and intensity), Good Production Design (Mostly just for the studio band room, as I really enjoyed the warm lighting they used), Pacing is very fast-paced, as this helps mimic the rat-race of trying to achieve perfection; the movie slows down in the right moments to really amplify the intensity and anxiety of scenes (especially the playing scenes), Climax is executed perfectly as it shows the journey Andrew goes on and takes control of his career; the final shots really are ambiguous and help leave the movie open to multiple interpretations, Tone feels like a psychological thriller mixed with musical elements, The movie does so much with such a small budget of 3 million dollars; there are some noticeable continuity errors with the movie (like how he rents a car when he's only 19 and how the players in the climax are visibly reading music when they are supposed to be playing from memory). Overall, the best interpretation of the obsession of the artist as there is so much nuance to the message and morals of this movie, like whether or not it's worth pushing yourself past your mental breaking point to achieve your goal; the direction, screenplay, score/soundrack, technicals, and performances from Simmons and Teller really make this one of my favorite movies of all time and an excellent example of what you can accomplish with such a low budget.

Overall, an incredibly beautiful story on the effects prison has on men (especially innocent men) as they have to come to terms with their lives as they are stripped away from their freedom and have to continue to find hope even though the system keeps on trying to strip it away from them (something that makes you care for the subjects and makes you cheer and cry for them); moreover, the film is 1/3 of the trio of 1994 that is the embodiment of cinema before that year (given by the story telling and feel of the movie being from the 50s-60s).",1994.0,06/05/2021,198.0,tt0111161

Overall, and Incredible Movie that stands up to being 'One of the best movies ever made' as it is the definition of subtly and symbolism (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions) in a movie as Coppola delivers a magnum opus not only in his career but for the whole film industry (something that others have tried to learn from).",1972.0,06/10/2021,199.0,tt0068646

Overall, a Great to Incredible Movie that stands up to being 'One of the best sequels ever made' as it is another definition of symbolism and visual queues (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions, especially Michael's eyes looking into characters) in a movie as Coppola offers a continuation of a story rather than a sequel.",1974.0,06/11/2021,200.0,tt0071562

Overall, a bad movie that is a clear cash grab by using the Godfather name as it is a simple/dull movie that is horribly cut and contains many amateur elements, and while a third movie did need to be made it was clear that it was too late as the way this movie was presented makes it so distant from the previous two (making the audience start to see the downfall in Francis Ford Coppola's abilities).",1990.0,06/11/2021,201.0,tt0099674

Overall, a movie with brilliant moments and brilliant aspects that is dragged down by its extremely long runtime and slow pace; despite all of this, the movie was great as it explores the relationship between family and profession against the backdrop of a space exploration epic in one of Nolan's finest moments (even though he may falter at times).",2014.0,07/05/2021,207.0,tt0816692

Overall, a Pretty Good to Good movie that was very entertaining to watch the narrator devolve from a consumer lifestyle to a point where he loses himself in a modern day retelling of 'Catcher in the Rye' (Which is kinda a reason for why I did not like parts of the movie cause it was extremely annoying).",1999.0,07/19/2021,210.0,tt0137523
A Quiet Place Part II,8.5,"Great Direction, Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Emily Blunt, Very Good from Cillian Murphy, Good from Millicent Simmonds, Good from Noah Jupe, Good from John Krasinski, ), Good Story, Good Screenplay (Uses less ASL makes the movie a bit more 'Blunt,' but the movie uses plot points throughout the movie to tie the movie together), Decent to Pretty Good Score, Great Cinematography, Great to Incredible Sound, Plot Structure was Good, Short runtime is used effectively as no scene is really unused and there really isn't anything that needs to be added/cut, Build to the climax was great with the final 15 minutes being a very well executed sequence that kept me on the edge of my seat, The movie was scarier than the first (but uses more jump scares to achieve this); movie sort of ends on a cliff hanger but does have some closure to what will happen to the characters. Overall, a movie that is more of a direct continuation of the first as it uses a larger budget to make a better movie that is scarier, better executed, and a better watch overall (something I hope the spin-off builds on).",2020.0,07/22/2021,211.0,tt8332922
The Wrestler,9.3,"Great Direction, Pretty Good Acting (Incredible from Mickey Rourke, Very Good to Great from Marisa Tomei, Decent to Pretty Good from Evan Rachel Wood (Some moments were good and some moments were pretty bad), Decent from the rest of the cast (anywhere from pretty bad to pretty good)), Great Story (the plot develops into seeing how being past his prime has an effect on the Ram as he tries to escape loneliness), Very Good to Great Screenplay (With some moments being Incredible with the dialogue and symbolism and some moments being pretty iffy), Score use was subtle, Cinematography on a spectrum (nauseating a lot of the times, but the single camera action does help show the loneliness of the Ram), Great Editing (Used well to show how the Ram still views/hold onto his life as a wrestler even though he is well past his prime (best scene to show this was his walkup to working his first shift at the deli)), Pacing was good towards the ends of the movie but the third act out of 4 felt really slow and dragging at times; runtime was good (no need to add/cut scenes,maybe in that third act), The build to the climax was a full 180 and very sudden (not executed very well overall) but the actual climax of the movie was its best moment (climax/ending of the movie was incredible and extremely well done as you see how the Ram comes to terms with the choices he has made and the path he sets for himself (especially on how he views his relationships with his lover and his daughter/ his relationship with the fans), The character of the Ram was very well written as a lost soul who clings onto the highs of his life but instead dives deeper into the loneliness of humanity; very accurate representation of wrestling and wrestling technique. Overall, a Great to Incredible movie that shows the loneliness of clinging to the past and the eventual hole you can never get out of as we view the life of the Ram trying to come to terms with his life despite the best parts of his wrestling career being behind him (though the third act out of 4 was not as well executed as I would have liked it to be).",2008.0,07/24/2021,212.0,tt1125849
Leaving Las Vegas,4.4,"Decent Direction, Pretty Bad Acting (Very Good to Great from Nicolas Cage (In a Nic Cage Way; the most Nic Cage performance I have ever seen), Good from Elisabeth Shue (Dull in terms of execution of dialogue but very good in terms of actions and gestures), Bad from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (I like the way it flows and how the story is told from the perspective of the end), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was very poorly written but the actual actions the characters take were good; no major symbolism), Score/Songs were very Vegas-esque with this jazzy sound and not necessarily bad but were just way extremely overbearing in the film and took away from the story, Decent Cinematography (especially for it being super low budge), Terrible Sound (I did not like how overbearing the score/music was in the story and how it made it incredibly hard to hear the dialogue at times), Good Editing (I liked some of the metaphors it placed with the different cuts), Pacing was very bad and incredibly slow (the first 10-20 minutes of the movie were meant to be the prologue but was just way to long and slow in terms of developing the story and characters); the runtime was at just under 2 hours but definitely could have cut the movie by like 30 minutes to make the movie have a better pace and remove a lot of unnecessary scenes, The build to the climax was like not really there but kinda there (not executed that well overall), The relationship that the two leads have is decent and not bad but like its too formulaic and safe; Nic Cage's character is a decent character but was just way too Nic Cage in terms of its mannerisms and acting (you will know when you see it) but the portrayal of an suicidal alcoholic was not that bad; the movie was completely formulaic overall (Scene of dialogue and action -> Overbearing Jazz score that pans to the either Vegas of the characters -> Songs with the same panning -> Fades to black to the next sequence). Overall, a bad movie as its only saving grace is to see the performance that won Nic Cage an Oscar (In the most Nic Cage way he could do it) and nothing else because the entire movie would have been awful if it was not for him as this low budget film really could not have been saved by the material (which was not that great to begin with).",1995.0,07/25/2021,213.0,tt0113627

Overall, a decent, fun watch that was geared mostly for kids as it was good to see how two icons (MJ in the NBA and Bugs Bunny in Looney Tunes) were able to come together to give off a lot of iconic moments with the battle with the monstars as the movie does not try to take itself too seriously.",1996.0,07/28/2021,214.0,tt0117705

Overall, a Great to Incredible Movie that shows some of the dangerous and true natures of India while highlighting some of its beauty as Danny Boyle pulls off an incredible rendition of 'Indian Forrest Gump' by loosely basing a story from the source material to show a bollywood rendition of the 'rags to riches' trope in what is an incredible watch.",2008.0,08/01/2021,215.0,tt1010048

Overall, a Pretty Good movie that has a lot of great moments and shows how the different characters lives intersect as they deal with their past trauma, but it falters from its inconsistent pace, terrible use of runtime (Given that it is extremely long and still does not manage to tie up loose ends), and very questionable ending (Something I see a lot from PTA).",1999.0,08/09/2021,216.0,tt0175880

Overall, a Pretty Good movie that contains a lot of iconic moments and is a fun watch as we see the protagonist try to live some of his last moments of youth before growing up, but the movie is still pretty shallow with its content as it reeks of the 80s (especially with its subjects and meta storytelling).",1986.0,08/16/2021,217.0,tt0091042

Overall, a Decent to Pretty Good movie that makes you root for the characters and gets very emotional at times as you go through a baseball themed adventure but is very overrated as the film does not use its runtime effectively and stems away from the subject/purpose of the movie.",1989.0,08/16/2021,218.0,tt0097351

Overall, a very fun watch that makes me have confidence in the direction DC is going with their movies as this film has creative story telling, great characters, and great action sequences, even though it was very formulaic and a very similar/close-copy to Guardians of the Galaxy (which makes sense given its from James Gunn).",2021.0,08/24/2021,219.0,tt6334354

Overall, a great movie that starts off very rough (a true slow burn), but it is an excellent portrayal of finding one's self as they deal with personal struggles as we get a snapshot of a friendship exploring wine country looking for love, something that could have really been polished if the exposition was a bit tighter (making the movie possibly a 9.4-9.5).",2004.0,08/27/2021,220.0,tt0375063

Dune,8.3,"REDUX 02/10/2024: Very Good Direction (The film is incredible on a macroscale because it does an amazing job at accomplishing the goal for this movie, to build the world (especially Arrakis) and its inhabitants (Mostly the House of Atreides, the House of Harkonnen, and the Fremen); the movie is decent on a microscale because it just follows typical Sci-Fi style direction; the direction of actors is very typical to other Sci-Fi movies (so very stiff); the storytelling is very similar to other Sci-Fi epics (though it does do a good job in showing how grand the franchise is); Villeneuve builds tension very well as he uses action and sound to really showcase how epic the Dune series is), Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Timothée Chalamet (Holds his own as the lead towards the end, but he really does not feel like Paul Atreides (and was probably cast just for his name)), Good from Rebecca Ferguson (Does a good job being the motherly figure to Paul and showing how he has a birthright to her bloodline as well), Good from Oscar Isaac (Really embodies a moral leader and a guiding figure for who Paul will eventually be), Good from Josh Brolin (Plays a good mentor figure to Paul and a good solider for Leto and the House of Atreides), Good from Stellan Skarsgård (Plays the villain well and establishes the conflict between the House of Harkonnen and Atreides), Decent from Dave Bautista (He's barely in the movie), Decent from Stephen McKinley Henderson, Decent from Zendaya (She's barely in the movie as she's meant to be a bigger character in Part 2), Decent from Chang Chen, Pretty Good from Sharon Duncan-Brewster (Does a pretty good job at showing the relationship the Freman have with the Empire), Good from Jason Momoa (Does a good job in showing the mentor/mentee relationship Duncan has with Paul, while at the same time showing how he is a loyal solider to the House of Atreides), Good from Javier Bardem (Does a good job in showing the relationship the Freman have with Arrakis and their disdain for spice harvesters), Decent from the rest of the cast (Everyone just feels like a character in a Sci-Fi movie)), Decent to Pretty Good Story (The concept is very true to the novel as it follows the first part of the book with its worldbuilding, but the characters and names are not as captivating as other Sci-Fi franchises; the plot structure is very spread out and dense as it uses its long-runtime to stay very true to the first part of the Dune novel (but this comes with a cost as it makes the movie feel very dragged out), the movie was a lot longer than it needed to be because at least 30 minutes could have been cut (especially towards the end); flow between sequences is kinda stiff/forced and similar to other dense Sci-Fi movies; character writing is pretty good as they created each group of people well and did a good job in establishing Paul Atreides's role in the overall conflict), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue is very Sci-Fi heavy as it uses a lot of jargon that they have to explain (jargon that honestly feels made up); the symbolism is pretty evident as you can see the metaphors that spice harvesting has with colonialization (plus the importance of morality vs capitalism), but the concept of a Lisan al Gaib/chosen-one is a trope very similar to other Sci-Fi epics; the foreshadowing is executed very well as it lays its roots throughout the movie to show Paul's powers and his purpose in the series), Great to Incredible Score (Used very well to build the world and tension), Incredible Cinematography (Has many grand breath-taking shots and is essential in building the world (especially the vastness of Arrakis)), Incredible Sound (Does an amazing job in setting the tone, establishing how grand the world is, making the fights feel crisp, and building tension), Incredible Editing (Makes the movie feel incredibly polished and well executed from a technical sense), Incredible Visual Effects (Really helps establish how epic  the Dune film franchise will be as it helps give it grand Sci-Fi feel), Great Production Design (Especially with establishing the Sci-Fi elements and the dunes of Arrakis), Very Good Makeup (Helps give the film a unique Sci-Fi feel (especially with the blue eyes and the Harkonnen)), Very Good Costumes (Felt unique and gave the movie a real Sci-Fi feel, mixed with desert themes), Pacing is incredibly slow as the movie really drags a lot with its long and plot-heavy runtime, Climax is different because there were really two: the first climax was executed well but the second climax happens almost 30 minutes after that and it makes the movie feel dragged out in the end, Tone feels very similar to other Sci-Fi epics (especially with its forced jargon and tropes), Seeing the movie in IMAX really did it justice as you see how much of a technical achievement this movie is (and the HBO Max same-day release really was an injustice for this movie); the movie is just worldbuilding as it is meant to set up Part 2 to being an amazing epic (something that is similar to how the book is written). Overall, a technical achievement in film as the movie does a great job in planting roots and establishing what the Dune franchise will be, but the movie feels like a sacrifice as mirrors the source material in that it is entirely world-building and meant to set up an epic second part.

Overall, a movie with great visuals and the presentations of a great space epic that acts as more of a prologue and beginning of a story than a full movie, though it does suffer from bad storytelling that makes the movie hard to follow; hopefully, this means that this part one sets up part two to be a better movie.",2021.0,02/10/2024,223.0,tt1160419

American History X,8.5,"Good Direction (while a lot of the conversational moments with smaller character or extras was pretty bad, the more important moments and grand scale moments were carried out very well), Decent to Pretty Good Acting ( Incredible from Edward Norton (range of emotions, ferocity, and epiphany were carried out very well), Pretty Good from Edward Furlong (Good in some moments and Pretty bad and emotionless in others), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (Minor characters were Decent to Pretty Good, extras and very small characters were Pretty Bad)), Pretty Good to Good Story (Really liked the way the story was filtered between flashbacks in B&W and current in color, the fall and redemption of Vinyard was a bit formulaic, but the story towards the end really was carried out very well to show the message of the story), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (Symbols were a bit overt (though they were good in what they were trying to show) and the dialogue was very meta and forced), Pretty Good Score, Great to Incredible Cinematography (especially the way to show flashback being B&W (showing Vinyards past of separating color) with the present being in color (to show Vinyards future to look at multiple facets)), Great to Incredible Editing (helping with the cinematography), Plot Structure was good as it is a story that mixes past and present to move the story forward, Pacing was very good (nothing to really take out), The build to the climax was very good as the climax of the movie really shows the true nature of how life really is; it was the correct decision to end the movie at the climax as it really leaves the audience understanding how life really is, the character and arc of Derek Vinyard is fascinating as (though formulaic) as it shows the way influence has in corrupting the mind and it is only through self-exploration that real thoughts can be formed; the message of the film is very clear and a good way to end the movie as it shows how America is a nation filled with flaws from Racism though the beauty is try to overcome and learn from this (even though everyone is not ready to do so). Overall, a good watch to show the importance influence can have on corrupting the mind as we go through the story of Derek Vinyard (through an incredible and powerful performance from Edward Norton) to see how America is a nation filled with flaws and it is up to us to learn from and overcome these flaws (even though some may not be ready to do so), even though the movie may be meta and simple and representation in this message.",1998.0,11/09/2021,225.0,tt0120586

Overall, a coming of age drama that is a bit generic but is carried by Robin Williams' performance and iconic lines as you root for the characters in the end, even though the movie ends very abruptly.",1989.0,11/10/2021,226.0,tt0097165

Overall, an Incredible Movie that used the setting of a dying Suburban America to show the true beauty of America and finding self purpose when it may be too late, something that is effectively carried out in a career defining performance from Kevin Spacey and an Incredible Screenplay filled with many symbols.",1999.0,11/17/2021,227.0,tt0169547

Overall, an incredible movie that is one of the most fun watches anyone can ever have as the audience goes through the incredible adventure of Forrest Gump's life to see how much someone can do despite having so little (A true testament of the importance love and heart can have as a driving factor).",1994.0,11/22/2021,228.0,tt0109830

Overall, a Great movie that is incredible for the first 3/4 as you get to see Martin Scorsese work in his natural element to create one of the mob movies that defined him as you go through the life of Henry Hill and his rise in crime, though the final 1/4 of the movie felt dragging and underdeveloped (leaving the audience not as satisfied as they were throughout the film earlier).",1990.0,11/23/2021,229.0,tt0099685

Overall, a decent to pretty good movie that showcases the youth of the 70s in the movie that put Matthew McConaughey on the map, even though it may be a bit overrated and boring at many points.",1993.0,11/24/2021,230.0,tt0106677

Overall, a very poorly executed movie that cannot be saved by performances from Lady Gaga and Adam Driver as the direction, screenplay, tone, and terrible acting make this movie extremely hard to watch and a mess overall.",2021.0,11/30/2021,231.0,tt11214590

Overall, a great remake of the original as we get to hear and see new faces, and old, carry out iconic characters and numbers as this new rendition pays homage to the original in may ways while also holding its own as it brings back the flair and numbers that make West Side Story one of the most well-known musicals of all time.",2021.0,12/25/2021,235.0,tt3581652

Overall, a good watch that stands the test of time as we get to see George Bailey find out the true importance of life and how valuable it really is in this Christmas classic, even though it falters in its plot structure taking away from its best elements.",1946.0,12/30/2021,236.0,tt0038650

Overall, a fun movie to watch that is filled with many memorable quotes and good laughs, but what holds the movie back is it reeking of the 00s Rom-Com archetype with its predictable story and constant cliches, so it would probably be a fun movie to watch in the background or picking it up in the middle on TV.",2005.0,12/31/2021,237.0,tt0396269

Overall, a movie carried by Andrew Garfield as he transforms himself into Jonathan Larson as he tells the story of building a legacy and to keep on going (even if you never get to see your success), though it held back by some of its numbers, limited acting/direction, and very bad CGI.",2021.0,01/06/2022,239.0,tt8721424

Overall, it is great to see Adam McKay play more to his roots at not taking himself too seriously as he creates a funny comedy that has some real highlights, though he still has a big mess on his hands from a pretty poorly structured plot and forced political message that is not told well.",2021.0,01/06/2022,240.0,tt11286314

Overall, a movie that is fueled by the best performance that Will Smith has ever given as he transforms himself into a compassionate father that wants his daughters to succeed, though it does falter from its feel-good tone and its revisionist history given that it is told from the Williams' family perspective (though it gets a lot of small details right which I do applaud).",2021.0,03/21/2022,247.0,tt9620288

Overall, a nice conclusion to Daniel Craig as James Bond as we get to see him close out the character on his own terms in a very action packed, emotional manner, but the movie does not really compete with his other movies like Skyfall and Casino Royale due to the subpar screenplay/story and questionable performances from Rami Malek and some of the minor characters.",2021.0,03/25/2022,248.0,tt2382320
Drive My Car,8.7,"Great Direction (The way the director was able to get the most out of his actors while also putting together different shots to help display the loneliness and trauma of the characters was great to see), Very Good Acting (Not one performance was better than another (it felt like everyone played their role the way it was meant to be written and played their part in helping display their trauma)), Good to Very Good Story (While the actual plot is minimal and a bit mismanaged, the different points that help show the characters overcoming their trauma was a nice subtle touch), Great to Incredible Screenplay (Even though it is a translation, the screenplay felt very natural and personal; it was as if the characters were letting out all of their emotions when trying to move past the hardships they felt), Score was poorly used (the movie rarely used the score as it opted for more ambient noise, but because of this it felt extremely slow; either use a score or do not use a score, do not just minimally use it), Good Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound, Good Editing, Plot Structure was not managed well (The exposition was almost 30 minutes when it could have been 15, the middle acts could have cut like 20-30 minutes as most of it is just white noise/characters not really doing anything, and the resolution kinda felt out of place as it is part of the ""covid"" world when it really did not need to set in a contemporary world), Pacing was bad as the entire movie felt like it was dragging (Because the movie felt like it was 30-45 minutes longer than it should, it just has a lot of emptiness in it that makes the overall move feel slower (which does not help when they do not use a score)), Build to climax was prevalent (though a bit too prevalent) as it really shows what the characters need and how they are going to get it; climax was executed very well as it is the most touching part of the movie (with the characters leaving everything out there and attempting to move on with their lives), tone was consistent throughout as it was a somber tone the mimic the state of the characters, A movie that handles dealing with trauma very well as we can see how these characters are effected by their past actions and how they are holding onto the past (which is not allowing them to move forwards). Overall, a very well made and written movie that looks at the effects of holding on to trauma and the importance of letting go as we see all the characters be parts of a well oiled machine, but where the movie really fails with its extremely long runtime and mismanaged plot structure as it really feels like the movie is dragging a lot (something the viewer has to get past to see the hidden beauty).",2021.0,03/27/2022,249.0,tt14039582
The Power of the Dog,8.5,"Very Good to Great Direction (The different choices she made were stylistically very beautiful and artistic, though I did feel she made some questionable choices more for shock value), Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Benedict Cumberbatch (A performance that showed both the harshness of a man while also highlighting his closeted nature), Very Good from Kirsten Dunst (Was able to capture a woman who spirals into a dark alcoholic state very well as the change in action from hope to losing herself is seen through her performance), Good from Jesse Plemons (was a more calmer foil to the harshness of the main character, which limited the availability he could give with this performance), Pretty Good to Good from Kodi Smit-McPhee (the character was not really written that well as it is more of a nerdy, not strong character that uses more of subtly than overt actions, but I also did not see him go above and beyond in this role either), ), Good to Very Good Story (felt the different parts of the movie were spread out pretty well and the actually closeted nature of the main character was foreshadowed throughout the movie; moreover, the subtle actions of the character really do come around full circle towards the end), Good to Very Good Screenplay (the dialogue was well written but the main point of this move is the use of its subtly (even though it may be too much) and use of heavy symbols), Very Good Score (really had that western fell and was used very effectively to help show the tense nature of a scene and to keep the movie rolling), Very Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Incredible Production Design (I really felt the location choice for filming along with the sets were very beautiful and helped capture the beauty of the west very well (a very similar feeling I got from Brokeback Mountain)), Good Costumes (really liked the western feel a lot as there was the western hardworking men juxtaposed by the elite (similar feel to Red Dead Redemption)), Plot Structure was good for the most part as the movie was effectively laid out into different acts that helped with the pacing (though the last two acts did feel very rushed), Pacing was good for the most part as I felt the score helped give it a good steady pace (but I felt that the movie is really rushed towards the end and could have benefited from 10-15 more minutes), Build to climax was extremely abrupt as it heavily relies on the audience paying attention to the subtly of the characters and what they did in their past acts; climax is more just thrown on us because the director wants us to piece together the subtly to make a conclusion on what happened (something I was not really a fan of), Tone of the movie was very harsh/western for the first 3/4 but then becomes a bit more lighter towards the end (which I was not really a fan off cause it was a little too late), The movie relies way too much on subtly as a method of communicating meaning and I feel that it is too much (causing a worse viewing experience than if it was a mix of dialogue/subtly); there is a major shift in the movie between two characters and after that point the movie really loses its charm as the pacing is very rushed and the ending is really thrown at us as we have to draw conclusions on what happened (which I really thought was a lazy tie up). Overall, a movie that is very artistic in its use of subtly and production design as we follow a cowboy come to terms with his own identity, but even though the movie is well made, it falters from relying too much on subtly and ultimately leaves the audience with more questions in the end.",2021.0,04/06/2022,250.0,tt10293406
Chinatown,9.2,"Great to Incredible Direction (Polanski really moves the story forward in the typical noir style, but adds his own twists that make this movie stand out from the rest), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good to Great from Jack Nicholson (Plays his character very well as it is a character who is constantly haunted by the demons he faced in his past), Good to Very Good from Faye Dunaway (Is able to go past the damsel in distress character as she offers her own reasons to why she is doing what she is doing), Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (The different points and elements really work well with each other as the different clues foreshadow what is going to happen (as well as detail why the past is so important to the characters), the ending is really realistic of what actually may happen; but the way the actual story was laid out was a not really balanced as there were moments were it felt they were spending too much time on small things and too little time on big things), Incredible Screenplay (Very true to the noir style and the symbolism is really prevalent in not only physical form but how it effects the characters (aka the meaning of ""Chinatown"")), Good Score, Good to Very Good Cinematography (really enjoyed the POV shots and the moving camera), Good Sound (typical of a 70s movie), Good Editing, Good Visual Effects/Stunts, Plot Structure was not laid out in the best way (there is a lack of exposition (we are kinda just thrown into the lives of the characters), the middle parts of the movie spend a bit too much time on different smaller elements and very little time on important elements, and the ending/climax is also a bit rushed), Pacing was a bit all over the place as it can be either very slow or very fast at times (especially the end which is extremely fast), Build to climax was present but extremely fast (though i did like this to an extent); climax was incredibly short but the best part of the movie (really shows what the overall meaning is), Tone of the movie is very noir-esque and plays this very well, I understand why the movie is called Chinatown (for symbolic reasons) but for the movie to only have the final 5 minutes be the only time they are ever in Chinatown is really disappointing (like looking at it from a consumer perspective and not a filmmaker's perspective). Overall, a classic that still holds up very well as a very well written story mixed with some of the best talent of the time makes the movie a film noir that is very similar to the time in its presentation but very different in how it lays the plot together and how things finish off (though it does falter a bit in its plot structure and pacing of different elements).",1974.0,04/11/2022,251.0,tt0071315

Overall, an action movie with a lot of action sequences that were carried out nicely and had good moments, but lacks a well structured plot and screenplay that could not save the themes and relationships they were trying to portray.",1994.0,04/19/2022,252.0,tt0110413

Overall, A revolutionary film that still holds up since it premiered as it incorporated many groundbreaking elements that are used by films to come as Orson Welles defines a new generation of filmmaking, even though it did run very fast to the point were it was hard to pay attention to what was going on.",1941.0,04/27/2022,253.0,tt0033467

Jackson (had limited range throughout the performance but it was easy to see where he had to let go of the direction he was given), Acting on a Spectrum from the rest of the cast (Bad from the rest of the live-action cast; Great voice acting (really brought to life the iconic performances of their characters))), Incredible Story (The actual structure and storyline was very well told cause it really bridges the descent Anakin has in being the chosen one to falling to the darkside through the illusion that it will help Padme (especially really shown in the final hour)), Bad Screenplay (To where it is memorable and iconic; None of the language was natural and felt very forced (but there are just so many memorable lines from how bad they were written that I loved it; the foreshadowing and symbolism actually is told very well (giving further proof that Lucas is a good Storyteller but terrible dialogue writer))), Incredible to Brilliant Score (One of the best John Williams scores he has ever made), Great to Incredible Cinematography (especially in the scenes where the subjects are small pieces of a large canvas), Good Editing (The cuts between different shots was Great but the transitions between scenes felt very lazy), Great to Incredible Visual Effects (Especially considering when the movie was made and a majority of it is through Green screen and effects), Incredible Production Design, Incredible Makeup, Incredible Costumes, Plot Structure was laid out very nicely as all the elements really built off of each other and every element played an importance, Pacing was great as it really kept a steady pace throughout (with no need to add or cut on runtime), Build to climax was incredible as the final hour of the movie was building to the fall of the Jedi; Climax was incredible as it was one of the best moments in Star Wars history (especially the Anakin vs. Obi-Wan fight), Tone was very typical of the prequels and Star Wars (but the darker tones were a night touch as it brought a depressing aspect with glimpses of hope), The movie was a real redemption for the prequels as we already expected the bad aspects of the movie yet we were still surprised the grandeur and level of story writing which makes this movie an iconic story in the Star Wars saga. Overall, An incredible story with the technical achievements that really make this movie a must watch and a favorite of mine as it helps bridge the prequels with the original trilogy, even though it does reek of the bad dialogue and direction that the rest of the prequels suffer from.",2005.0,05/11/2022,255.0,tt0121766

Overall, an iconic movie that is a fun watch but really does reek of the 80s with its writing and acting as the audience has to get past the pretty simple plot to see the moments that make Top Gun a famous movie for its time.",1986.0,06/03/2022,260.0,tt0092099

Overall, a great action movie that is far better than the original as it builds off of the first movie very well through its well executed action/fighter pilot scenes and improved personal scenes, making this legacy sequel a must watch to relive old memories created from the original movie.",2022.0,06/04/2022,261.0,tt1745960

Overall, one of the worst movies ever created with how much money was put into this and the output they got as there is not a single good thing to say about this movie (and I really hope nobody has to go through the struggle of having to see it, even for the meme).",2022.0,06/07/2022,262.0,tt5108870

Very Good to Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (Really excelled at playing the naive kid who is interested in helping very well, shows a bit of inexperience but that is to be accepted when he is playing a very young character that is the hero), Very Good to Great from Harrison Ford (The real star of the show in all his scenes as his smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (though there are moments that are kinda iffy with the awkwardness and silence from line deliveries)), Pretty Good from Carrie Fisher (Her performance does not compete with the others but she does play the damsel in distress character trope very well (though it is a bit annoying when she is changing between accents as it sounds like she is putting on a fake English accent at times)), Pretty Good to Good from Peter Cushing (Not really that much in the movie despite his high billing), Great from Alec Guinness (Really shows his experience as an actor in this performance as he has much range in showing both care for Luke yet trauma from his past that still effects him), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (Really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (Created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Brilliant Story (Created a world that is one of the most iconic today; the character writing is incredible as they are some of the most iconic characters in pop culture; the way the story ties all the different movies together (both prequel and later films) is very well done and visionary), Very Good Screenplay (The actual dialogue was not that well written as it felt very unnatural (as was seen from the characters trying to say the words), but where the screenplay shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines, and character writing to introduce the Star Wars universe as a cinematic achievement), Brilliant Score (One of the most iconic scores in cinema history and is very well used throughout the movie), Great Cinematography, Incredible Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life), Very Good to Great Editing, Cannot rate Visual Effects (The original Visual Effects were incredible for how revolutionary they were at the time of the release, but the added CGI from the re-release makes it very hard to watch as it just feels so forced and out of place with the original effects), Incredible Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as each piece builds on the previous one as everything matters in building up the movie and moving the story forward (so nothing to really add or remove), Pacing can be a bit slower at times but does maintain a very steady pace throughout the movie (pace very typical of movies from that time-period), Build to climax was very well done as the movie treats the actual build as the climax (so we are building to this build very nicely throughout the movie); Climax was kinda thrown at us as in the grand scheme of things we did not build to this (we built up to the build as previously stated) but it was very well executed and really shows off the technical marvels that the original film was very groundbreaking for; moreover helps provide some insight into Luke's quest in finding the force and taking his first step in becoming a Jedi, Tone was that typical to a space opera or science fiction epic but does have some unique feel to it that makes it very Star Wars, A ground-breaking movie not only in Cinema-history but actual history as well as it ushered in a new way to view and create stories and was an inspiration for the rise in the Science-Fiction genre in the 80s and 90s.

Overall, a movie that is a very good watch and has things to watch for (like direction and acting) as we get to see Dustin Hoffman enter the Hollywood scene with a very comedic movie that is groundbreaking in the rom-com genre, but the film suffers from a very imbalanced plot structure as it favors the Mrs.Robinson relationship a lot more than it should.",1967.0,06/14/2022,264.0,tt0061722

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,9.7,"Great Direction (The actual moving of the story and making sure all pieces come together is incredible managed and executed, and this movie is a definite improvement in directing people than its predecessor as the director was really able to get more out of his actors in their performances for this time around), Very Good to Great Acting (Very Good from the Live-Action Cast; Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (showed the progress he has made from being a naive/hopeful kid to someone more cognizant of the present and the work he needs to put in to be a better Jedi), Great from Harrison Ford (the real star of the show in all his scenes as he smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (and he really cleaned up the delivery of his lines in this movie as there are not any awkward pauses as there were last time), Good to Very Good from Carrie Fisher (She really improves this time around as she is given more freedom to play as opposed to last time; she also really grows as a character from being the damsel in distress to being a loving leader), Good to Very Good from Billy Dee Williams (Really becomes a memorable presence in all the scenes he is in with his cool nature that conflicts/competes with Han, though there is some hiccups in delivery as he is still getting used to the Star Wars universe as opposed to the other members of the cast), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship; and really grows the character to show how loving he is towards his new friends), Great to Incredible from Frank Oz (Really brought the character of Yoda to life with the puppeteering and the vocal performance, Good to Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Incredible Story (Really sets up different elements of the universe very nicely and uses the concept of parallel storylines very well; also has some of the most iconic moments of the series and does a good job in building the downfall of the characters; the only issue this time around is that it does not have the ability to build worlds like the previous film could), Great Screenplay (The dialogue this time around felt way more natural and was better written; the screenplay still shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines (with it having one of the most iconic lines/plot twists in cinema (or even narrative) history)), Brilliant Score (Takes what was great from the previous film and adds some new themes that really make this score stand out as well), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Which really stands out in the Luke vs. Vader scene), Very Good Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life, but there are some issues with Sound in this movie as there feels like a delayed sound with the lightsabers (which is very annoying if you have watched the prequels)), Very Good to Great Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (This movie does not really go overboard with the new visuals of the re-release as much as the other movies so it is easier to comment on), Incredible to Brilliant Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history, and really added to that with the Hoth/Dagobah/Bespin sets which are regarded as some of the best in all of Star Wars), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as it has three major parallel story lines that all converge to the climax and the end (something that helps keep the audience engaged to see how the different arcs are coming along), Pacing was better in this movie as it felt more consistent and not as slow as the last one, Build to climax is done very nicely as it is really pivots the franchise into seeing who these characters really are as they have to make important decisions for the future; Climax was the best part of the movie as we get to see what Luke's training has come to/seeing the rest of the crew into action as we get to see how much the characters have grown yet see how far they really are to their goals in the sage; moreover one of the most important lines in history is delivered in this climax that make Star Wars a franchise memorable, Tone does not play as much into the space opera or science fiction epic as the last one but does have shades of it; feels more like a standout movie that really transcends genre in many ways (while still keeping the same star wars charm), Really can be felt of as a stand alone movie (even though it leaves so much to be answered with its ending) as we get to see the rise and fall of the characters as they must continue their own individual quests to grow as characters. Overall, a brilliant movie that really builds on where the last movie left off and improves on it in so many ways to make it a very memorable film that is not only the best in the series but in film history as we see a more mature Star Wars in the characters that take part in it.",1980.0,07/03/2022,272.0,tt0080684
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,8.2,"Very Good to Great Direction (Really enjoyed the mechanical yet cartoonish feel as it really felt like it helped set the tone of the movie being in a factory as well as it being a Roald Dahl story; also, the direction of actors was fine enough to where there were no major issues), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Johnny Depp (Really was the commanding figure that is needed from Willy Wonka; was able to switch between a cheerful yet apathetic man who is deeply effected by his past trauma very well as these transitions are seamless yet cartoony to a feel that makes sense for the movie), Good to Very Good from Freddie Highmore (plays his role well as the cheerful and hopeful boy who is the moral compass for the movie), Pretty Good to Good from David Kelly, Good from Helena Bonham Carter, Good from Christopher Lee (plays a very Christopher Lee role that is toned down a bit for a children's movie), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (In terms of how iconic of a story the film is based from, it really does a good job in painting the world created by Dahl; the only issues with the story come towards the end as it really feels to drag on as we get to the final two kids), Good Screenplay (A very cartoony, kid-friendly script that plays to a Dahl story pretty well; also, good use of foreshadowing throughout (though it makes it a bit predictable)), Good Score, Good to Very Good Cinematography (It does a good job in helping us come into this world as each of the different rooms has its own type of style (with the last kids room having a Kubrick esque approach given the movie they are watching is 2001: A Space Odyssey)), Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (though it was a bit easy to see the limitations that early 2000s CGI had in making this movie), Great Production Design (The sets really brought this film to life with its ability to tell the story of the rooms/scenes it was in), Good Costumes (More so for Willy Wonka as his costume really steals the show for the film), Plot Structure was a major issue that holds this film back because it spends way too much time in the exposition (the film gets to the start of the factory tour at the 40 minute mark) so the movie really seems to drag and become forgettable after the second child (so the movie really should have cut 15-20 minutes from the film (especially the background scenes for Willy Wonka)), Pacing is fine for a good portion but really starts to drag after the second child is over (given by the issues from the plot structure), Build to climax was pretty anti-climatic and really is not that interesting because the movie has really dragged on for so much that it is pretty hard for the audience to care; climax was pretty uneventful as it is more about Willy Wonka facing his demons rather than the actual climax for the meat of the movie (the tour), Tone was very well established as cartoony and mechanical as Burton does a really good job establishing this throughout the film; i was also a fan of the more darker approach it takes at some moments, I have not watched the original movie so it is hard for me to compare both of these movies. Overall, a good movie that is well made and driven by its Director and lead actor (Johnny Depp) as it is fun to see us go into the world of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but it suffers from a mismanaged plot structure to the point where the final 30 minutes really feels like a chore to go through.",2005.0,07/04/2022,273.0,tt0367594

Overall, its just a kids movie with adorable moments, but not that serious of a movie (even though the social media marketing has made it an importance to go see this movie (which I do love)).",2022.0,07/07/2022,275.0,tt5113044

Overall, a very good satire that is a fun laugh as it pokes at the zombie genre in a very unique way, though it can be very simplistic and safe at times.",2004.0,09/02/2024,281.0,tt0365748

It was this weird middle ground and the actual ending was pretty anticlimactic), Tone was very kubrick in style but had some shades of mystery that kept the viewers interested, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman might not have been the best cast for this movie as even though they are married they do not really show that much chemistry. Overall, an interesting watch as the audience gets to see Kubrick give off his sendoff (with many elements that are synonymous to his style) in a story that captivating for the most part, but does not deliver to the level he is known for with not so great writing and final act that really falls apart towards the end.",1999.0,08/18/2022,287.0,tt0120663

Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Good from Mark Hamill (A real step back in this performance as he is more reserved and over-the-top (which makes sense given he is now a Jedi), and really is not able to capture the same charm he had in the first two films (even when it is warranted)), Very Good from Harrison Ford (The only one of the main cast who does not have that far back of a drop-off in his performance as he really has to play to his instincts/experience from the character to give this performance (which shows some drop off but is nonetheless the charismatic star of the show)), Decent from Carrie Fisher (Really took a step back in her performance as she reverts to someone who is not able to keep up with the cast (with the lack of inflection and big pauses in delivery)), Pretty Good from Billy Dee Williams (not as much of a presence in this film as he lost the charm that made his character so lovable from the previous film, though still does have some good moments), Pretty Good to Good from Ian McDiarmid (Though limited, he did show why he was the right choice for the emperor), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (Really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (Created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship; and continues to show how loving he is towards his new friends), Great from Frank Oz (Really brought the character of Yoda to life with puppeteering and the vocal performance, though he really does not have that much to work with this time), Very Good from Warwick Davis (also for other Ewoks, a debut role that really helped play to the adorableness of the Ewoks), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast; Very Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story (Even though the film switches back to its more linearly story-telling style, the overarching story does do a good job at bringing the trilogy to a close), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue takes a step back from its improvements in the last film as it is very obvious at times where George Lucas wrote the dialogue as it is very unnatural; The overall structure of foreshadowing and symbols is worthy of Star Wars praise (Still with some iconic lines)), Brilliant Score (Continues to take what was great from the previous film and adds some new themes that really make this score stand out as well), Great to Incredible Cinematography (Which really stands out in the Luke vs. Vader scene), Great Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life), Very Good to Great Editing, Pretty Bad to Decent Visual Effects (While there are some monumental moments, there is a wide use of bad Green Screen (which was easy to see) and an excessive use of pyrotechnics (to where it just got annoying); there are also many flaws from the new edition that were so painful to watch (example being the Jabba's palace scenes)), Incredible to Brilliant Production Design (Some of the best sets in all of Star Wars that are so iconic and well remembered in history, with the Tatooine/Endor sets being some of my favorite from the series), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context; also, the ewok costumes were so adorable in how they were designed to where it added to us caring about them), Plot Structure went back to the linear structure but does a good job in setting pieces together and making sure everything comes together in the end, Pacing was good and not too rushed or slow, Build to climax was good as it helped build the relationships between the different characters (Luke and Vader as well as Han and Leia); Climax was a bit anticlimactic (as even though they went for luke to be the better man, it just did not have the flare that the previous movies had as it was meant more for closure in the characters rather than entertainment), Tone goes back to being a mix of a space opera/science fiction epic as the movie really acts as the final act in the saga (needing the other two movie's support to keep it going), As a movie meant to close out the saga it does a good job in bringing closure to character arcs and stories (but this movie cannot really be a stand alone film). Overall, a step back from the previous Star Wars films by reverting back similar bad habits (with George Lucas's poor dialogue and over use of effects), but the movie does do a good job in ending the saga with its world-building and great storytelling (something that makes the Original Trilogy one of the most respected in movie history).",1983.0,08/28/2022,291.0,tt0086190

Overall, a very personal movie from Spielberg that goes through his coming of age story as we see why he became a filmmaker and different homages to his most famous works, but overstays its welcome with the third act really falling apart and being cliche.",2022.0,12/20/2022,305.0,tt14208870

Overall, a movie that is carried by Fraser's performance with a story that is very heartbreaking, but feels very similar to other Aronofsky films (like Black Swan and The Wrestler) which takes away at something great they could have had, coupled with a hit-or-miss screenplay and questionable performances from the rest of the cast.",2022.0,01/04/2023,307.0,tt13833688

Overall, a masterclass in subtlety as the direction mixed with Blanchett's performance drives forward a very intense movie without doing/saying that much, but the film's potential is ultimately held back by its long runtime and poor plot construction (which is a shame because these reasons will limit its staying power in film history).",2022.0,02/02/2023,316.0,tt14444726

Overall, a decent watch that follows the iconic character of Pinocchio in a unique way as the audience gets to see him tackle darker concepts of the importance of family and what is the meaning of death, but is a pretty hard watch given how choppy the movie is with its lackluster direction, acting that is not fluid, stop motion animation (which is not necessarily a bad thing), and editing..",2022.0,02/16/2023,317.0,tt1488589

Overall, a movie that has good acting and is good from a micro-scale (especially with the discussion scenes), but really falters on a macro-scale as the direction and bad plot construction really makes the movie very boring and feel like nothing actually happened (to where this movie probably would have been better suited off as a play)..",2022.0,02/19/2023,318.0,tt13669038

Overall, a great movie that has many iconic elements to depict a grand and tragic event as we see James Cameron step outside of his comfort zone to create one of the best love stories ever told on film, though it is really held back from its long runtime that really could have been cut to make the climax more tight.",1997.0,02/26/2023,319.0,tt0120338

Overall, a movie that has very well executed horror sequences, but overall feels like it panders more into the splatter genre than actually making a movie as it cares too much about being gory and providing scary moments than having a well structured horror plot because of how bad the writing and plot construction is (with the biggest issue being how the conflict is handled throughout the movie).",2023.0,03/19/2023,328.0,tt13345606

Overall, a movie that was a decent watch as it follows the standard Seth Rogen/2010s comedy template to bring East Asian female representation to the comedic world, but is ultimately not really made for me as the film is a hit or miss on jokes given I have kinda outgrown the raunchy comedy style and a lot of the jokes were geared towards East Asians (so I could see how the East Asian female demographic would really enjoy this movie).",2023.0,03/19/2023,329.0,tt15268244
Theater Camp,9.0,"Great Direction (Really told the story well through this mockumentary lens as we get to see a guerrilla style approach to how the theater camp is a mess; uses transitions very well instead of narration to help provide non-sequitur moments to move the plot forward (especially in a comedic way); really gets a lot out of the actors (especially the child actors) as they are allowed to play through improv to build comedy), Very Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Molly Gordon (Really plays off of Platt's character well as she plays the out of touch with reality character very well), Very Good from Ben Platt (The real force that other characters play off of as he uses his theater experience well to show someone who is trapped in a world they do not want to leave), Good from Noah Galvin (Plays the steady role very well throughout the movie but really comes out towards the end), Very Good from Jimmy Tatro (Has basically perfected this role from all the similar roles he has been in as he effortlessly plays this douchey, finance bro), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast (Especially the child actors as they do a great job in using improv to help build scenes and create humor)), Great Story (The mockumentary structure really helps in keeping the story interesting as it allows this satire to make fun of what actually goes on at a theater camp; also the plot is laid out very well as it uses the transition slides to move the story forward while also adding humor), Great Screenplay (Considering the movie was mostly improv it is very impressive what they got off as it incredibly funny and captivating what is going on in the scenes; the symbols and messages throughout the movie are pretty prevalent), Pretty Good Score, Very Good Cinematography (The handheld style really gives the movie a documentary feel as if we are right next to the subjects of the movie), Decent Sound, Good Editing, Plot Structure was laid out very well as it was very evident which part of the plot we were as the movie follows a countdown to the performance at the end, Pacing was a good pace (no need to add or cut runtime), Climax was the best part of the movie as it was them putting on the play after everything in the movie was culminating to this moment; this part also had some of the funniest bits of the entire film, Tone was very satirical in nature as it never tried to take itself too seriously by keeping things light-hearted (there was some flavors of Will Ferrell in the tone as well), Saw the Texas Premiere at SXSW (The best movie of the festival in my eyes).

Creed III,6.8,"Decent to Pretty Good Direction (For his directorial debut, Jordan does a decent to pretty good job at moving the story together while also providing a unique feel/style to the franchise; he gets a decent amount from his actors (but it is still pretty evident that there are some limitations from this rookie effort)), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Michael B. Jordan (Really expanded his range this time as he can hang longer during some of the more emotional/dramatic scenes, but there is still some limitations in his performance that are obvious as he is still playing the Michel B. Jordan character), Pretty Good from Tessa Thompson (Continued where she left off in the series, but is not really given that much to work with this time around as it is more someone comforting Creed rather than exploring her own issues), Decent to Pretty Good from Jonathan Majors (Did fine to hold his own, but his character was not written in a way that gives him enough to play (it is a very closed off character)), Good from Phylicia Rashad, Decent from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (The story elements are pretty simplistic and basically all that was shown from the trailer (thus making it very predictable); the story really stems away from the Rocky legacy as his story line is basically extinct in this film; though there are issues, the story itself is fine and is told well as there were some elements that were handled well (particularly the parts not about boxing (like the issues with family) as that in itself makes it very similar to the first movie)), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (The writing was very over-the-top like Creed II as it is all about fighting the system and trying to get out; the symbolism is decently prevalent as it is about allusions to the past (creating a lot of parallelism throughout the film); the major issue I had with the writing (though a very biased take) is how they barely mention Rocky as he is alluded to twice and his name is only mentioned once), Pretty Good Score (Not really used super well throughout the movie but was used well in the moments it was really needed in (especially when they used old themes from both the franchises)), Good to Very Good Cinematography (I actually really enjoyed this as it helped provide the hype of the movie and helped give that Anime feel that Jordan was looking for), Very Good Sound (Surprisingly the aspect of the movie that really stood out as I felt they really helped make the punches feel very crisp and actually helped a lot with building the boxing scenes), Good to Very Good Editing (Helped provide that Anime style that Jordan was going for and overall was a pretty well edited movie), Pretty Bad to Decent Visual Effects (While the effects themself were not that bad (I actually enjoyed them in giving that anime feel) I felt like the movie relies a bit too much on it during the fighting scenes (which takes away at what the real feel and nature Rocky traditionally was)), Decent Costumes (The trunks were decently designed but none of them felt really iconic like the other Rocky trunks), Plot Structure was a real issue with this movie as it was way too short (15 minutes shorter than the other Creeds) and this led to a very poorly structured plot; the main issue of the movie is that it takes way too much time in trying to introduce the conflict that the actual fighting of the conflict and the scenes people really care about the most from a Rocky/Creed movie are starting to only happen with 30 minutes left; moreover, the movie does not really do a good job in building the setbacks in Adonis' fighting journey as they are only mentioned rather than worked on; Runtime should have been 20 minutes longer to really help build the rise in the conflict as there were no real issue with the scenes in the movie, more of the lack of, Pacing was good for the most part but it did feel like the last 30 minutes were rushing (something that the 20 minutes of runtime added could have helped), Climax was executed decently well as it is the same fighting climax every other Rocky movie has (it was a bit unique in the story-telling and fighting style), Tone was very similar to the other Creed movies but did not have any of the Rocky charm those movies had; the Anime influences of the movie were also pretty prevalent and were somewhat unique, The franchise is no longer a Rocky franchise so it is really hard to treat this movie as a Rocky movie (even though it is kinda being billed as one) as this movie really cannot get my Rocky bias. Overall, a decent to pretty good watch in this part of the Rocky/Creed franchise as we get to see some unique features in new storytelling and fighting scenes, but the movie does have its issues as it is way shorter than it should've been given the plot really does not build the rising action at all and there is no real tribute/allusions to Rocky himself (which makes it hard for me to really compare this movie to others in the franchise given my bias towards the original movies).",2023.0,03/21/2023,331.0,tt11145118
Air,8.1,"Good Direction (Helps build to the tone of the movie very nicely and does a good job in getting the most from his actors; progresses the story forward in a very safe way (which mimics the 80s in itself); really pulls more from experience to finish the project than try anything groundbreaking), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good from Matt Damon (Plays his character very well and uses more experience than research into the character (kinda a similar performance in Ford v. Ferrari)), Good from Ben Affleck (Similar to Matt Damon's performance as it felt he was more pulling from experience than research into the character), Pretty Good to Good from Jason Bateman (Started off a bit rocky but got his footing as the movie went on and got more screen time), Good from Marlon Wayans (Surprisingly my favorite performance of the movie as he acts the most natural and in tune with what is needed from him (it is just a shame he is only in the movie for one scene)), Pretty Good from Chris Messina, Pretty Good from Chris Tucker (Plays the very Chris Tucker esque character (so also just pulls more from experience)), Good from Viola Davis (Really commands the scenes she is in, but is not able to go above and beyond like her other movies because of the material is working with), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Good Story (Does a good job in not having too many moving parts as it only has a a week or two time period that they dive really deep into; the story is laid out well; it is pretty obvious how much of this story was fabricated (but they were never really trying to go for a based on a true story film so it gets a pass)), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (The movie does do a decent job at making the vernacular sound very 1980s; the dialogue is kinda over the top at times as it is pretty obvious when the script is going for the commercial or awards scenes shot; the symbolism is a good as it can get for a biopic (like Sonny analyzing Jordan's jump shot); the foreshadowing is surprisingly present and handled well (like the pink shorts for running)), Good Cinematography (Has the feel of a startup-guerilla style documentary at points, but is still polished to that of a big budget movie), Good Sound, Good Editing (Very similar to 80s movies and sports movies of the 80s/90s (like Jerry Maguire)), Good Production Design (Helped give it that 80s vibe), Plot Structure was laid out well as it focuses on a few events and does a really good job at trying to get as much detail from these events as possible, Pacing was incredibly fast (an intentional thing that I really enjoyed) as it mimics the pressure in Nike trying to sign Jordan, Climax was decent to pretty but felt a little over-the-top and more motivational than it needed to be, Tone was very 80s and the movie does do a good job in helping build this with the vernacular/production design/vibes; the movie also has a bit of a startup/business feel with the quick pace and content, I really respect how they never showed Michael Jordan's face of the movie as that would really take away from the real stars (his mother and the people at Nike) and story (how Nike was able to work with the parents to get Jordan to sign); I also really enjoyed how the movie really never took itself too seriously as it felt like the crew wanted to have fun more than win awards. Overall, a very fun watch about the story of how Michael Jordan signed with Nike as the all-star cast really propels the story forward to make this movie very enjoyable, though it really does not go above and beyond in any way as it is a pretty straightforward biopic with cliche writing (which is kinda the point as it felt like this movie wasn't taking itself too seriously as it was just a couple of friends having fun on a project).",2023.0,04/01/2023,332.0,tt16419074

Overall, a decent children's movie that does a good job in staying very true to the games and is carried by its voice cast, but is limited by it being mostly a children's movie (with only nostalgia keeping adults interested) and a very short runtime as the hero's journey really cannot develop (along with the relationship between Mario and Peach).",2023.0,04/10/2023,333.0,tt6718170

Overall, a chaotic mess from a talented director as he fails to direct this poorly constructed horror film as he tries way to hard to be edgy and grotesque rather than actually be a good storyteller with a compelling script, so much to the point that the cinematography/sound/editing and performance by Phoenix cannot save this 3 hour mess from being watchable as it feels more like a waste of time then a compelling watch.",2023.0,04/24/2023,338.0,tt14081570

Overall, an iconic movie that brought Japanese animation to the western world on a grand scale as the iconic story and direction really tell a compelling narrative, but it is held back by its runtime as it spends a bit too much time on the exposition and rising action to where the climax feels incredibly rushed and the movie closes a bit anticlimactically (something 20 minutes of extra runtime could have helped).",2001.0,05/01/2023,340.0,tt0245429

Overall, a well written movie that has a very memorable performance from George Clooney as we get to see him navigate the subject matter in a very captivating way in order to show how striving for success and unattainable goals can lead to loneliness, though it does feel restricted by the tone and storytelling as it makes the movie feel a bit dated from the time.",2009.0,05/04/2023,341.0,tt1193138

Overall, a good end to the trilogy that has become a staple in the MCU as James Gunn uses tone/writing/visual effects to build off his previous comedic movies while also creating what might be the saddest/most touching Marvel movie (mainly through the backstory/writing of Rocket), but the movie does fall under the trap many Marvel movies follow as it is a bit too restricted by the predictable MCU boilerplate to be more profound that it is capable of being.",2023.0,05/07/2023,342.0,tt6791350

Overall, a complete miss from one of my favorite comedic actors of the 21st century as he creates a very shallow movie with no substance as the script and direction really do not play into his strengths at all, making the movie not funny or profound in any way (making you wonder how this project even got green light).",2023.0,05/12/2023,343.0,tt9013340

Overall, a decent superhero movie as the more micro elements of the movie coupled with the playful tone made the film a fun watch and engaging overall (especially the dual role of Ezra Miller and Michael Keaton returning as Batman), but the overuse of CGI and the pretty predictable plot makes this movie a bit too late in the race to the Multiverse.",2023.0,06/01/2023,347.0,tt0439572

Overall, a groundbreaking movie as we see a new/fresh retelling of the Spider-Man story through the use of revolutionary animation and great storytelling, something that brought back the 2D animation style and started the Multi-verse trend.",2018.0,06/01/2023,348.0,tt4633694
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,9.5,"Great to Incredible Direction (Really brings a unique flair to telling story as it takes elements from the previous movie while also adding more mature tones to show a more holistic representation of the Spider-Verse and their characters; Gets a lot more out of the voice actors this time around; creates an even more grand opus of a universe as the fighting and animation are used in conjunction to create such captivating images (building off an already brilliant animation style); the attention to detail in the micro scenes were also nice to see), Good to Very Good Voice Acting (Good from Shameik Moore (Has a very similar performance as the first one, embodies the role of a young Spider-Man navigating different pressures in life), Very Good from Hailee Steinfeld (Builds off the last performance very well as she shows more dimensions to the character and really steals the scenes she is in), Very Good from Brian Tyree Henry (Continues to give a multi-dimensional vocal performance here as he shows the angry and loving side of being a father; also does a good job in playing the comedic relief in the scenes he is in), Very Good from Luna Lauren Vélez (The biggest improvement from the previous film as she shows so many emotions to display a caring mother who really wants what is best for her son (even if that means letting him go)), Good to Very Good from Jake Johnson (Shows a bit more range this time around as the element of being a father allows him to be more empathetic to Miles), Good from Jason Schwartzman (Not too much a menacing villian but does a good job in the scenes he is in), Good to Very Good from Issa Rae (The force she is in the movie is really displayed through this vocal performance as we how important she is to the Spider-Force), Good to Very Good from Karan Soni (Really embodies an Indian Spider-Man very well), Very Good from Daniel Kaluuya (Steals the scenes he is in as he has somewhat of a loving tension between him and Miles, Kaluuya also seems like he is just pooling from his experience being a British actor), Very Good to Great from Oscar Isaac (The real menacing force of the movie and the true foil for Miles, steals the scenes he is in by showing why he does what he does), Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (Really builds from the last movie as they steer away from the template that made the last movie predictable and showed more about Mile's importance in the Spider-Verse; the darker elements of the movie were also great to see included as it shows both the good and the bad of being a Spider-Man (especially about the parallelism in timelines); there are many iconic elements of the story that will eventually be told in pop-culture (like Canon events)), Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue this time was more powerful and profound in its meaning as it really touched on the ideas of purpose and growing up; Jokes not as funny this time (which is kinda byproduct of it being more of a serious movie); The symbolism really improves this time around as it is way more evident and really helps in showing the meaning/message of the movie (also the easter eggs were also really nice to see as they help tie the worlds together/are nice things to see); the foreshadowing was an integral part of the movie as it helped show the parallelism between the different worlds and how some events were predictable (also the small details act as important elements for how the story unfolds later on in the movie)), Incredible Score (Builds on an already great score form the first movie as it keeps all the good themes from the first movie while adding new genres to shows the personalities of all the different characters; used very well to help build suspense (especially during the beginning and end with Gwen))/Good Soundtrack (was fine but just not as many hits as the first movie), Great Sound (especially during the fight scenes), Incredible to Brilliant Editing (Really build on the last movie as it brought all the worlds together while still keeping that comic book feel as the first movie; the editing strengths were shown very well in the fighting scenes as it helps bring together all this small elements in the macro sized scenes), Brilliant Visual Effects/Animation (Builds off the revolutionary 2D animation style they used in the first movie as they use different animation styles to help give character to the different worlds (with the Gwen world being the most visually appealing through the use of colors); again is used well to help tell the story with the different visual text elements; the animation of the fighting scenes were also stunning as they really showed their full capability in making such beautiful worlds), Plot Structure was kinda the biggest fault of this movie just because of the nature of the movie (the movie is one of two parts so its a constant build to a cliffhanger), Pacing was a bit on the slower side (though a better pace than the last movie) as it seems the directors wanted to use the fact that this movie is one of two parts to help build the scenes well without being too fast; Runtime was fine (given this movie is one of two parts, I feel like they used the runtime well to build everything up to a point where you are leaving wanting more), Climax was incredible as it was incredibly suspenseful and shows some of the hidden messages of the movie; the movie leaves off in the middle of the climax (creating this cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more), Tone was a bit more darker this time (though the beginning is pretty similar to the first movie) as it helps show how Miles has to prove himself in the universe and how he needs to navigate the pressures of being Spider-Man while also growing up, The Indian representation of this movie was a Chef's kiss as it was nice to finally see the largest populated country in the world portrayed in one of the franchises in Pop-Culture (and in a good way as well). Overall, another groundbreaking film in the franchise that only builds on everything they created in the previous film as the brilliant animation and incredible writing is used to show the audience a well-rounded story about a Spider-Man who is trying to find his place in the world, with the only major drawback of the movie being that it suffers from the flaws of it being one of two parts.",2023.0,06/03/2023,349.0,tt9362722

it is also great to see that they not only spend a lot of time on the Manhattan Project but the aftermath too as that is where the real message of the movie lies; The non-linear storytelling was an homage to Nolan's first break Memento as it helps with showing the consequences of the Manhattan Project), Brilliant Screenplay (One of the best screenplays I have ever witnessed in that the dialogue is so natural yet profound as actors can converse with each other with ease and it is embedded with symbols meant to tell the story; the symbolism is incredibly profound and some of the best I have ever seen in a movie as there are many symbols throughout the movie to help show the message it is trying to present; one of the best uses of foreshadowing I have ever seen as a second watch shows how hesitant the scientists were in creating the bomb given the implications it may have on humanity), Incredible Score (Incredibly complements the movie well and is used very well to build emotion and create pace and tension throughout), Incredible to Brilliant Cinematography (The mix of IMAX cameras with large format 70 MM cameras shows the grandeur of the operation and how larger than life the project was (as well as the aftermath); the mix of color and black-and-white help show different perspective and lenses throughout the movie), Great Sound (The sound editing was incredible as the sounds they used to create the explosions (and the lack of sounds at some point) help build tensions throughout the movie; the mixing of dialogue was an improvement from the previous Nolan movies but it still is an issue as there are some moments were the dialog is hard to hear), Incredible Editing (The cuts were incredibly fluid and some of the best work I have ever seen as they were so mesmerizing the watch on the big screen), Incredible to Brilliant Visual Effects (Some of the best effects work I have ever seen as the use of practical effects over CGI show the capabilities filmmakers have without the use of expensive technology), Great Production Design (This is specifically for Los Alamos as they did a great job in building a makeshift town), Very Good Costumes (The costume work for Oppenheimer is iconic and will be a big part of pop culture for years to come), Plot Structure was very unique and non-linear as Nolan takes a page out of Memento to use a non-linear structure to tell the narrative (and I am a big fan of this as it helps show the effects the Manhattan project has on the future and implications it has on the scientific and American community), Pacing was incredibly fast as the movie flies by its long runtime to fit in as much story as it can (this is neither really a positive nor a negative as there is nothing that could be cut from the movie), Climax was incredible as the movie really culminates to this moment (and this is done very well given how the movie jumps between time periods to help the audience holistically know the bigger picture), Tone was a culmination of a war bio-pic/courtroom-drama/grand epic as Nolan uses his signature style to take the best elements of all three to help establish a very unique tone, Saw in IMAX 70 MM and it really is an experience in itself. Overall, a modern masterpiece that transcends the biopic as Nolan delivers a masterclass in direction, writing, and acting (with Cillian Murphy delivering a career-defining performance) as the movie is breathtaking from top to bottom with how it uses many different elements to help share its true message about the horrors of one's creation (and the implication it may have on the future).",2023.0,07/24/2023,358.0,tt15398776
Barbie,8.1,"Good Direction (Although she does stick to her typical style of filmmaking, she uses a more palatable style of storytelling that incorporates meta humor that does not take itself too seriously to tell her messages; she builds both the Barbie World and the Real World very well; she gets a good amount from her actors (even though it is just so stupid at times what she has them do, an aspect that I kinda enjoyed, to be honest)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Margot Robbie (Uses more of her experience as an actor and celebrity to play the role as she polls from many aspects of her career to create a multi-dimensional version of a once very shallow character), Very Good from Ryan Gosling (The real comedic relief of the movie as he steals the show in all his scenes with how silly and stupid he is; he is also a big driver of morality throughout the movie as he shows how the oppressed feel once they gain some ounce of power), Good from America Ferrera (Does well in her scenes and acts as the moral compass throughout the movie (bridging the divide between the Barbies and the Kens)), Pretty Good from Kate McKinnon (Plays the typical role she is used to playing), Pretty Good to Good from Michael Cera (The role of Allan was specifically written for him and he did his best embodying it), Pretty Good from Ariana Greenblatt (Plays her role well and acts as the youthful voice in the movie), Pretty Good from Simu Liu, Pretty Good from Issa Rae, Pretty Good from Rhea Perlman, Pretty Good to Good from Will Ferrell (Uses his experience as it is as if the role was written for him), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (Pretty simplistic overall as it follows a pretty standard template but it pays homage to many different movies and is laid out well; the ending was pretty predictable though (and kinda feels like they didn't close up some of the messages they were trying to present)), Good Screenplay (Dialogue flows well (even though it is a bit on the nose/meta); jokes were surprisingly funny and helped make swallowing the message easier; the symbols and messages of the movie are taught throughout the movie and done so in a very easy way to understand given how overt they were (which is good cause there are surprisingly many nuances to them despite the subject matter/how it is told); foreshadowing was somewhat there but not as good as it could have been), Pretty Good Score/Very Good Soundtrack (More of a soundtrack than a score-based movie), Good to Very Good Cinematography (Really enjoyed the shots they used in Barbieland as it helps give it a cartoony yet cheap feel), Good Sound, Very Good Editing (Really enjoyed the assembly line shots in Barbieland as it helped give it a simulation feel), Good Visual Effects, Great Production Design (Really what makes the movie as the sets were great to look at with its cheap feel and how pink they were (giving a very big doll-house vibe)), Very Good to Great Costumes (Really help give the Barbie feel of the movie as they fit the doll vibe and help bring color and flavor to the movie), Plot Structure was pretty simplistic overall as it follows a pretty standard template (similar to that of a coming-of-age/trying to save your village type of movie), Pacing was good as it was not too fast or slow (no need to cut or add any content), Climax was decently executed as it shows some resolution in the conflict (but it does not do that great of a job tying up all the loose ends as it feels kinda forced), Tone was very cartoony/Barbie as it did a really good job at establishing this throughout the movie; there were also many different flavors of Greta Gerwig's style that were mixed throughout this movie. Overall, a feminist powerhouse of a movie as Greta Gerwig exceeded my expectations to create a very fun movie to watch as it is filled with an enjoyable cast, funny jokes, and memorable production design, costumes, and soundtrack as the movie tells many different messages about self-image and societal power, even though it is very on-the-nose about it and does not tie up all the loose ends.",2023.0,07/24/2023,359.0,tt1517268

she holds herself well in all the scenes she is in and becomes a central figure for others to work off of; even though her performance is not as dynamic as the DiCaprios and Di Nero's, she still can show so much with so little as her sickness and loss shows what is being taken away from her), Very Good from Jesse Plemons (Holds his own very well and acts as the objective, outside entity looking into the situation), Bad from Brendan Fraser (Just feels very out-of-place and forced; just unnecessarily over-the-top and had no chemistry with any of the other castmates), Good to Very Good from the rest of the cast (Really hold their own and show why Scorcese is a master at getting the best out of his actors)), Very Good Great Story (The best part of the film was it was well laid out and entertaining to see the conflict slowly peel layers to see what is truly going on (turning from a mystery to a crime film in true Scorcese fashion); the characters were written very well as you know a lot about the motives and feelings of the native and white characters; the story takes a different turn from the source material and this is a very good choice as it shifts the perspective from the FBI to the Native Americans to show how they are experiencing the conflict; the biggest issue with the story is just how long it is as it could have been cut and still show the same story), Very Good to Great Screenplay (The dialogue is very heavy and well written as the audience is interested in what is being told on screen (though the heavy southern accents really doesn't help with understanding what is going on); there isn't really a 'narrator' like other Scorsese movies but they do use dialogue to help drive the story forward and show what is going on; the symbolism is incredibly present and helps show the impact the crimes have on the Osage and the lengths that greed has on individuals turning away from their morals; foreshadowing is great and helps with keeping the movie interested and well structured), Good to Very Good Score (The use of southern and native motifs helps with setting the scenes; the score is used well in helping build tension), Great Cinematography (Really helps with showing how polished this movie is and helps with making each scene look so captivating), Very Good Sound (Helps with building the tension and scenes (especially the absence of sound at points)), Very Good Editing (Edited very well as there are no major flows (and there are some shots where the editing was so seamless it showed how experienced Scorcese is at making pictures); the actual cut of the movie is long and editing really could've helped with making a bit tighter), Very Good Visual Effects (The use of practical effects helped with conveying the period), Great Production Design (Used both the Western and Osage aspects of the movie to help set the time period), Very Good Costumes (Helped with setting the period and giving the Osage a memorable presence), Plot Structure was a major issue for this movie as it the movie is just too long (the exposition and rising action as just unnecessarily long to the point where the audience is exhausted by the time the climax hits); the movie could've cut 30-40 minutes of the story to really help with making the runtime a lot shorter (and it would still be the same movie and give the same message), Pacing was incredibly slow as there is just so much plot to go through and there are many scenes where there is just open-air (this hurts with helping keep the attention of the audience as the movie just bogs down the further it gets), Climax was well executed and captivating (it is just the audience is so exhausted by the time they get to it, it hurts from captivating what is going on), Tone on the surface is very similar to a mystery with Western elements (but deep inside feels like a Scorcese crime movie), Liked this movie equally as much as I liked 'The Irishman'. Overall, a very good movie that is driven by the experience and chemistry of Scorcese, DiCaprio, and Di Nero as the director uses his signature charm to tell a captivating story about a dark time in American history, but its unnecessarily long runtime really brings the movie down from being something truly great.",2023.0,10/20/2023,374.0,tt5537002
Saltburn,7.6,"Pretty Good Direction (Controlled her scenes well on a macro-scale as she used the cinematography and the sets to tell how grandiose Saltburn was (and the dichotomy of how closed off everyone was because of it); Did a pretty good job on a micro scale as the one-on-one scenes were good (especially the ones between Keoghan and Elordi) but the group scenes were not that well executed; the storytelling is overall decent as the overarching story is encapsulated well but the movement between plot points is not as fluid as it could be (with there being some easily spotted continuity issues); Some scenes felt very elongated for no reason and were just really meant to shock rather than have any substance), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Barry Keoghan (Really captures the persona of this demented hero well as he shows the lengths the protagonist will go to get what he wants), Very Good from Jacob Elordi (Really uses his charisma and looks to help propel his performance as he really takes control of all the scenes he is in to act as this heavenly god that the main character is trying to chase), Good to Very Good from Rosamund Pike (Plays the dull/out-of-touch character well and has that elitist British tone that helps with her character), Good to Very Good from Richard E. Grant (Similiar to Pike in that he plays a dull/out-of-touch character well), Good from Alison Oliver (Has a lot of moments that are good as her character's emotional instability helps portray a young adolescent), Good from Archie Madekwe (Plays his character well and has good chemistry being at odds with Keoghan), Good from Carey Mulligan (More of a cameo appearance but does a good job in letting her presence be known), Good from the rest of the cast (Each actor plays their role well as they work off of the main cast)), Decent to Pretty Good Story (The overarching story is interesting and has a lot of mystery to it as the director slowly peels at what is actually going on; the storytelling is not the best as there are a lot of continuity errors (like Superbad being played on DVD before it is even out in theaters) and is not that clear at points; the characters were written well and have their clear purpose in the story (with the mystery of the lead character helping drive the story forward); There were just the right amount of plot points (it just felt like some of the overall scenes could have been cut down a bit); the movie does not tie everything up well (and this hurts the story as it is not meant to really have things left open to interpretation)), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue flowed very well and felt like it was of the time and the place; the symbolism is somewhat there but it does not help with portraying the message; the foreshadowing was good as it helped with showing who the main character really is (and was not that predictable)), Pretty Good Score/Good Soundtrack (really helped with setting the time), Incredible Cinematography (Really felt very grand and helped with showing how big and lost you can be in Saltburn), Bad Sound (The dialogue was not mixed well as a lot of times it was unclear what they were saying or the music was too loud that the dialogue just felt inaudible), Decent Editing (Overall was good and helped with showing how grand Saltburn was and how small the subjects were inside it; some of the scenes felt just unnecessarily long and could have been cut to provide the same effect (especially for the more grotesque scenes)), Great Production Design (The sets in Saltburn were just so grand and illustrious that they helped with showing the wealth the family had; the college sets were all very stunning as they helped show the history of the school; the party (and aftermath) was designed very well to just show how many people were there), Plot Structure was good as the points were laid out well and each overall component helped build to the next one (it is just inside of these components it did not feel like the story progressed well between scenes)runtime could have been cut down by making some of the scenes sorter as it would not have that much effect on the story (shaving maybe 5-10 minutes), Pacing was fine as it did not feel like it was too fast or slow, Climax was decently executed as it is presented in a very shocking way (but the more you think about it the more holes you see in the continuity), Tone was very similar to a coming-of-age mixed with a thriller and High-class British themes as this helps show the world the main character is living in, Saw a premiere at Austin Film Festival; the grotesque scenes were a bold choice but it does not pay off that well as it just makes the audience feel uneasy than actually showing how deranged some of the actions and characters were. Overall, a bold attempt at a grand movie in Emerald Fennell's sophomore effort as she really builds the grand world of Saltburn through cinematography and production design and gets a lot out of her actors (especially Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi), but, in the end, is held back by having too many continuity issues/loose ends and going overboard with the more grotesque scenes.",2023.0,10/27/2023,375.0,tt17351924
American Fiction,8.6,"Very Good Direction (Controls everything very well on a macro and micro scale as he uses comedy and social issues to propel the story forward; gets a lot out of his actors as the comedic moments feel very genuine and the dramatic moments feel very meaningful), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Jeffrey Wright (Really controls every scene he is in as he plays the line between Comedy and Drama very well (excelling in both areas as he shows off his experience)), Good from Tracee Ellis Ross (Makes an impact with her scenes with Wright as she plays off of him very well to help show the relationship the protagonist has with his family), Good from Issa Rae (Holds her own well as her comedic timing is good and works well at building tension between her and Wright), Good to Very Good from Sterling K. Brown (Has a lot of charisma in his performance as he uses his over-the-top comedic style mixed with dramatic experience to make his presence known in the scenes he is in), Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone does their job well and contributes to providing humorous moments and moving the story forward)), Very Good Story (Uses the source material very well to create a very contemporary story about how far virtue-signaling has gone in today's culture; uses many different story elements to help play both sides of the comedy-drama; Does a good job at building the character of Monk as you can see the conflict he has with career/family/race; the story progresses very well as each element of the plot is built upon till the very end (with the meta-narrative structure playing a big role throughout to mimic how the original novel was written)), Very Good to Great Screenplay (The dialogue is very good as it just feels very natural and helps keep the story interesting; the jokes were very well written as they are appropriate in showing how Monk thinks about the whole experience (with a lot of it coming from the scenes where he is pretending to be the convict); the symbolism is really prevalent as it helps with delivering the message of being against virtue-signaling and pigeon-holding racing into thinking they talk about certain topics; the foreshadowing is very unexpected as it really stems away from the traditional narrative structure to not have that many cliches), Pretty Good Score (Very Jazzy and helps set the personality of the protagonist), Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Plot Structure was well laid out as every element was prevalent and these elements flow between each other; the metanarrative elements do break the plot flow sometimes but in a good way as it helps with showing how the protagonist is really thinking about the situations he is in, Pacing was good as it followed the general pacing of a comedy; the runtime was good as there really was nothing that could have been added or cut, Climax was good as it showed the culmination of how far Monk went with the character (and has some elements that make it not so predictable to enhance the comedy of the moment), Tone was more in line with a comedy than a drama (with the dramatic elements feeling being more lighthearted than that it should've been), Saw a premiere at Austin Film Fest. Overall, a very good effort in Cord Jefferson's directorial debut as Jeffery Wright's performance and very good comedy writing/direction propel the movie into something very funny yet profound with its social commentary.",2023.0,10/27/2023,376.0,tt23561236
The Holdovers,8.7,"Very Good Direction (Employs a very traditional 70s storytelling style as it feels like he uses works from the time period (and some from the 80s) to influence how the story is told; controls everything well on a macro; really excels in on a micro-scale as the group scenes and especially the one-on-one scenes really drive the movie forward with its emotion and comedic moments), Very Good to Great Acting (Great from Paul Giamatti (Somewhat of a spiritual successor to his performance in Sideways as he carries off the smug demeanor of someone who suffers from digging their hole further into loneliness), Great from Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Does a great job working off of Giamatti and Sessa as she acts as the mother-figure for the main cast and embodies someone who is dealing with the trauma of loss; embodies the New England working class), Very Good from Dominic Sessa (Has great chemistry with Giamatti as he embodies someone trying to find his place in the world (and looking for Giamatti to be that unexpecting father figure in his time of loneliness)), Good from the rest of the cast (Play their role well (especially the child actors), but the film is mostly the main cast)), Very Good Story (The story is pretty simple and laid out well as it draws from many sources of inspiration to embody something made in the 1970s-80s (which kinda hurts it from being unique and going above and beyond); the character writing is very good to great as you get to learn about who they really are the more you get to know them (to where Giamatti's and Sessa's character are actually a lot more alike than they thought); the story elements are interesting and the flow is pretty similar to that of a Christmas/coming-of-age movie), Great Screenplay (The dialogue is very of the time and flows very well; the jokes were funny and embody movies from the time period; the symbolism was very prominent as it helps provide the message of finding purpose and the dangers of loneliness; the foreshadowing was pretty typical of movies from the 70s-80s (which made the movie pretty predictable)), Pretty Good Score (Helped establish the time and the Christmas tone), Good Cinematography (Gave the movie a very 70s multi-cam feel), Good Sound (The slapstick feel helped give the movie a 70s-80s feel), Good Editing (Felt very 70s and helped with setting the tone and time period), Plot Structure was pretty formulaic as it followed something from the 70s (but it does do a good job at having the plot elements build on each other), Pacing was a bit on the slower side (but this helped with giving the 70s feel); the runtime maybe could have been cut 10-15 minutes when the conflict was introduced to provide more emphasis on the relationship between Giamatti and Sessa's characters, Climax was executed very well as it is a real epiphany moment for the characters and invokes a lot of feel-good emotions from the audience (was definitely some of the best dramatic moments of the movie), Tone was very similar to Christmas movies (like A Christmas Story)/Dead Poet's Society/70s movies as this helped give the movie a throwback feel to the time period it is set, Saw a premiere at Austin Film Fest. Overall, a profound coming-of-age dramedy that really embodies the time period it is set as the performances (especially Paul Giamatti's) coupled with the writing really shows the impact loneliness has on people at different point's of their lives, although the movie is held back by playing too much into the time-period as it can only do so much with following the 70s Christmas trope.",2023.0,10/28/2023,377.0,tt14849194

The Bikeriders,7.9,"Good Direction (Controls everything very well on a macro-scale as the bike-riding and gang-affiliated scenes are very well choreographed and the most engaging parts of the movie (and this is only aided by the cinematography and editing); does a pretty good job on controlling the mirco-scale scenes (though they can get a bit repetitive); the storytelling is a little too similar to Goodfellas as it uses the first half to be a slice of life of the gang and the second half to show its descent into chaos; directs his actors well as the gang as it helps make the characters interesting), Good Acting (Very Good from Jodie Comer (Really embodied the character and took it as far as the material could take her; was the true protagonist of the movie as we saw the world through her eyes), Pretty Good to Good from Austin Butler (Was as good as he could be given his character isn't given that much to work with because of how mysterious and quiet he is), Good from Tom Hardy (Used a lot of experience playing a hardened guy to carry his performance; has good chemistry with Austin Bulter), Pretty Good to Good from Michael Shannon (Isn't given that much screentime but makes the most of what he is given), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Feels as if they are midwestern versions of Goodfellas or in the mob)), Good Story (The concept was very interesting as Nichols uses the source material well to create a very engaging story; The story construction felt very slice of life as the first hour was really about getting to know the people in the gang (which put a lot of emphasis on the end to show the downfall), but this presented some issues as not all the characters were that interesting so it dragged down the movie; the flow between sequences was not the best as the slice of life moments really don't build to anything and the flow in the second half feels kinda forced and rough; the character writing was very good as he wrote Kathy very well in being a caring partner trying to leave the culture and Benny as this ominous figure that has a sense of charisma)), Good Screenplay (The dialogue was pretty simple as it complements how the people in that culture and time spoke, a good amount of the dialogue was actually said in real life/from the recordings; the humor felt inspired by the time period and had some flavors of Goodfellas with how jokes were spread around the gang; there was minimal symbolism (could see the clash between the new and the old guard with the use of cars), but the overall symbol of the fall of the golden generation of biker gangs was present; the foreshadowing was pretty overt), Decent Score/ Pretty Good Soundtrack (helped with setting the tone), Very Good Cinematography (Felt very polished and was used very well in the biking scenes), Great Sound (Felt very crisp and made the motorcycle scenes more memorable and engaging), Good Editing, Pretty Good Production Design (Did a Pretty Good job at emulating the Midwest in that time period but did do that much research at emulating 'Chicago'), Good Costumes (Enjoyed the biker jackets and the idea of colors as it is used as a good plot point), Plot Structure was very similar to Goodfellas as the first hour is meant to act as a 'slice of life' into the biker gang and the second half is really about the downfall of the gang (but because of this the movie feels like it is dragging from the first half); about 10-15 minutes of the first half could have probably have been cut because of how repetitive it is, Pacing was different for each part of the movie (the first half was pretty slow in establishing the characters and a bit too fast in the second half), Climax was executed pretty well and shows the downfall of the golden generation in the gang (with it being engaging in certain scenes); the exposition does not do the best in carrying the momentum created from the climax but does a decent job at ending the movie, Tone was a lot more comedic than I thought it would be (would've liked to have seen more of the grit and dark nature of what it meant to be a Vandal during that time); emulates the tone of Goodfellas (which was a stylistic choice from the director), Saw a premiere at Austin Film Fest. Overall, a pretty good movie into the life of the golden era of midwest biker gangs as the performances (especially Jodie Comer's) and the technicals make this an engaging and interesting movie, though the slice of life nature drags it down the first half and rushes the overall conflict.",2023.0,11/01/2023,382.0,tt21454134

Overall, a movie that has a somewhat interesting premise led by the performance of Michael Pitt and good cinematography as it is pretty evident where it drew inspiration from movies like Raging Bull, Rocky, and The Wrestler to tell the story of a fighter-down-on his luck, but its lack of chemistry in the cast and writing flaws hold it back from being something memorable.",2023.0,11/05/2023,384.0,tt21987878

Godzilla Minus One,9.0,"Very Good to Great Direction (Great on a macroscale and a microscale as the former scenes were the fight against the physical protagonist (Godzilla) and the latter scenes were the fight against the invisible protagonist (guilt and the finding the purpose to live); Storytelling is effective as it uses time very well to see the impact guilt and the war have on the characters, and how the fight against Godzilla means so much more as they try to find a reason to live; the direction of actors is very good as everyone has their purpose and conveys a consensus for their attitudes post WWII and their fear against fighting another war (against Godzilla)), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Ryunosuke Kamiki (Shows a wide range of emotions throughout the movie and effectively conveys a soldier with PTSD and survivor's guilt as his perception of reality and humanity is skewed), Good from Minami Hamabe (Shows development throughout the movie and complements the protagonist very well as he fights through his own guilt), Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone does their job effectively and helps create this mass consensus of fear towards a post-WWII Japan and Godzilla)), Great Story (Concept is very fresh as it mixes the guilt from a post-WWII Japan with the monster attacks of Godzilla; the story construction is very good as each element of the plot is clear; the storytelling/flow between sequences is very fluid as each scene feels necessary and builds the story on both a macro scale (fighting Godzilla) and a micro scale (fighting guilt), it does rely a little too much on Deus Ex Machina to get the characters out of trouble (even though this is pretty standard for other monster movies); the character writing is great as they display the protagonist's struggle very well as his guilt/trauma from abandoning his post from the war is affecting his perception of what it means to be alive (and the hero's journey is overcoming this guilt)), Great Screenplay (The dialogue is very sharp and well written (flows very well and has a lot of profound meaning); the humor is subtle at times but does a good job in helping lighten the mood; the tension is a built very well as it builds throughout the movie and has a significant impact on the characters (especially the protagonist) as it helps build up the fights and the characters taking back their humanity; the symbolism is the best part of the writing as it is much deeper than I expected it to be as the movie touches many subjects like guilt, trauma, and what it means to be alive (something that definitely affected those who survived a post-WWII Japan as Godzilla acts as a metaphor for the impact of the Atom bombs and its nuclear fallout); the foreshadowing is very much present and is used very well to help predict the story (especially in the climax)), Very Good Score (Used very well in creating tension and conveying emotions throughout the movie), Decent Cinematography (The biggest issue for this movie as it made it feel a bit tacky in quality in respect to the other technical elements (though the aerial shots and the microscale scenes were well shot)), Great Sound (Helps with painting the battle scenes and bringing to life Godzilla, used well with building tension), Pretty Good Editing, Very Good Visual Effects (Very good job given how low the budget it is (Some highlights included the sea battles, but the city scenes were not the best as it was obvious they used CGI)), Plot Structure is well laid out as each element of the plot is evident and these elements build on each other as the movie progresses, Pacing was good as it is fast in the action scenes and a good pace in the more dramatic scenes, Climax was executed very well as it builds suspense and keeps the audience engaged as they see what happens next; the final shot of the movie was stupid and should have been a post-credit scene, Tone felt like a WWII War drama both in the time period and in the action, This year's sleeper hit (The Puss in Boots award). Overall, a great film that is executed well on a both technical and literary level as the well choreorgraphed action sequnces are coupled with surprisingly deep, symbolic writing as the movie tackles complex issues like survivor's guilt, trauma, and what it means to be alive, making this movie a must watch.",2023.0,12/11/2023,389.0,tt23289160
The Boy and the Heron,7.2,"Pretty Good Direction (Does a very good job on a grand scale as he builds these vast mystical worlds that are worth exploring; the direction of actors is very good as he does a good job in creating both animated and grounded characters; the storytelling for this movie is pretty lacking as the first half slice-of-life style clashes with the very plot-heavy style in the second half to where it is a bit confusing on what is actually going on), Good to Very Good Voice Acting (Very Good from Soma Santoki (Really embodies the character and carries the movie on both an innocent and ambitious level), Great from Masaki Suda (Really brings to life this animated, yet important character), Good from Aimyon, Good from Yoshino Kimura, Good from Shōhei Hino, Good from Ko Shibasaki, Good from Takuya Kimura, Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone plays their role well as they help bring to life such an animated, mysterious world through their characters)), Pretty Bad to Decent Story (The concept is decent (but just feels very similar to Spirited Away to where it doesn't feel that unique); the story construction is bad because the second half crams in too much plot since the first half is very slice of life, and this makes it hard to follow what's going on and what is actually important; the storytelling is pretty bad because there isn't any flow between the scenes (especially in the second half); the character writing is good as we do get to see the internal conflict of the main character as he uses this journey to get over the loss of his mother, and the minor characters do their job in buttressing this journey), Good Screenplay (The dialogue flows very nicely and is typical in style to other Studio Ghibli movies; the attempts at humor were good and did a good job at lightening the mood; symbolism is pretty prevalent (with themes about a post-WWII Japan and dealing with loss handled well); the foreshadowing was pretty standard), Very Good to Great Score (Used very well throughout the movie to help establish the tone and feel (feels very similar in style to Hisaishi and Miyazaki's other collaborations)), Good Sound (Helped create this magical and mysterious world), Good Editing, Great Animation (The best part of the movie as Miyazaki does an amazing job at creating these beautiful worlds as the movie is more of an art piece than a story), Plot Structure was the biggest issue for the movie as the exposition takes up too much time to where the rising action is incredibly rushed and there is practically no climax; the runtime should've stayed the same but some of the exposition should have been redistributed to the rising action to help strengthen the conflict and the storytelling, Pacing was very slow in the first half (because it is very slice of life) and very fast in the second half (as it tries to make up for time lost), Climax was incredibly disappointing as it just feels very anticlimactic and rushed (more of an afterthought than a pivotal scene), Tone was very similar to Spirited Away (sharing themes with other Japanese animated films with also having coming-of-age/supernatural themes). Overall, a very beautiful movie with its animation and score as it feels more like an art piece than an actual story, which is telling given how poorly constructed the plot is with its slice of life first half and plot-heavy/rushed second half.",2023.0,12/11/2023,390.0,tt6587046

The Iron Claw,7.9,"Decent Direction (Good on a Microscale as it helps build the wrestling world; not the best on a microscale as the interpersonal 1-on-1 scenes had a lot of stiffness; The storytelling was good as it really is entertaining/captivating to see what happens next the way the director builds up the story; the direction of actors was really dependent on the scenes (it was good in solo scenes but hit some limits and felt rough when it came to scenes that required more than one person as each character felt like they were acting in a silo)), Pretty Good Acting (Very Good from Zac Efron (Really holds his own as his transformative performance commands the movie as he carries the weight of this traumatic story on his shoulders (though there are some limitations when it comes to working with the other actors)), Good from Jeremy Allen White (Really brings his energy to the performance and works well with other actors in the cast (though there are moments where he is stiff)), Pretty Good to Good from Harris Dickinson (Does a good job in the wrestling moments but is not given that much to shine outside of it), Pretty Good from Maura Tierney (Does well with what she was given but does not have that much time to show off), Good from Holt McCallany (Carries out this one-dimensional character very well as he embodies what it means to be a father that pushes his family to the limit (though there is some stiffness when it came to working with the other actors), Pretty Bad from Lily James (Really is stiff in the beginning and not the best scene partner to Zac Efron (though does get better as the movie goes on), not her best performance as I’ve seen her perform better), Decent from the rest of the cast (There were some performances that were better than others, but there just felt like a lot of stiffness and lack of chemistry in the cast (except for the brothers))), Very Good Story (The concept was really good as it was really interesting to see the different characters in the family and how wrestling (and their father) pushed them to the limit; the movie was mostly factual as they did a good job in highlighting most of the main points while subtly glossing over some of the minor details (there is more an issue that there is just so much that happened in real life that they had to cut stuff out (like how there was another brother who took his own life); The story construction was really good as the movie was very entertaining for the most part since each element of the story helped build the overall narrative (though it does kinda falter a bit in the final 20 minutes); the flow between sequences is good as the movie does a good job at building scenes on each other to keep the story going; the character writing was pretty good as you get a good sense of each character, but besides Kevin, you don’t know the depth of each character’s struggle (and even though it is handled well, I would have liked to have seen more about how tainted the boys’ relationship was with their father)), Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue was pretty simple (which was intentional given the subject matter and the characters); the use of humor was pretty good as it made the brothers’ bond feel more realistic; the movie builds tension well as the use of different techniques coupled with the writing brings the audience on the edge of their seats; the symbolism is somewhat there (but as much as you would most likely see from a biopic); the foreshadowing was really good as there were many callbacks throughout the movie as the writing laid the groundwork for what was going to unravel towards the end), Good Score (Used well to create tension)/ Very Good (Used very well to help set the tone/time period), Good Cinematography (Used very well as it felt polished in the more dramatic scenes, but felt gritty with its one take single cam shots used for the wrestling scenes), Pretty Good to Good Sound (Good for the most part as it helped bring to life the wrestling scenes and building tension (though there were some hiccups in the movie)), Great Editing (A lot of the scenes were edited so seamlessly it helped with telling the story and keeping the movie captivating (with the best being the coin-flip shot and the Tom Sawyer wrestling montage)), Great Makeup (Their hairstyles were a  focal point for many of the character’s looks as it helped them look more like their real counterpart), Good to Very Good Costumes (Helped set the time period and illustrate the wrestling scenes), Plot Structure was laid out well as there is ample time in both the exposition and the rising action to build the story forward and tell the tale of the Von Erichs (but the climax and resolution were not the best), Pacing was good as it kept a steady pace for the most part (though it slows down a good amount towards the end), Climax was pretty anticlimactic (especially with one specific scene that felt out of place) as the movie kinda falls off with 20 minutes to go; the runtime could have been shorter if the ending was cut a bit, Tone was a mix of the obsessed artist trope (Black Swan, Whiplash, and The Wrestler) with the tone of The Bikeriders to set the time period and feel. Overall, a captivating story that is told through very good writing and great editing as the audience witnesses the rise and fall of the Von Erich family, but it is held back from being a must-watch by its stiff direction and lack of chemistry within the cast (though the singular performances of Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, and Holt McCallany did make the movie entertaining).",2023.0,12/14/2023,392.0,tt21064584

Overall, a movie that is carried by its performances and interesting story as Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore, and Charles Melton act as powerful storytellers for such an uncomfortable, traumatic scandal, though the movie just feels a bit too amateur with its forced artistic vision (imitating The Room at times) and leaves with so many questions that are left unanswered.",2023.0,12/17/2023,395.0,tt13651794

the use of cinematography/editing is very auter-esque as he uses his signature framed cinematography and editing style to tell this story (but in a more polished way than 'The Favorite')), Very Good Acting (Great from Emma Stone (A really brave performance as she brings to life Bella from her mind's infancy to it being fully developed (doing a great job showing her maturing and exploring her sexuality along the way)), Very Good to Great from Mark Ruffalo (A great over-the-top performance that steals the show at times as he introduces the ideas of high society and the corruption of the upper class to Bella), Very Good from Willem Dafoe (A real fatherly figure to Bella and uses his signature acting style to portray the character's mischievous nature), Good to Very Good from Ramy Youssef (A surprise dramatic performance from a more comedy actor as he has a sense of charm and chemistry when he works with Stone and Dafoe), Good from Christopher Abbott (Barely in the movie but fits into his role in very little time as he invokes a sense of anger and hatred for the audience), Good from Jerrod Carmichael (Works well off of Emma Stone in showing different aspects of society and ethics (but feels a bit off as he is the only one who doesn't have an English accent)), Good from the rest of the cast (There are few minor characters but everyone plays their role well and works off of the principal cast to elevate everyone's performance (This is a minor observation but why did he make everyone have a Victorian English accent when the whole cast was American (like he could've just had it set in America or have the cast at least be somewhat British))), Great Story (The concept was unique as it was Frankenstein mixed with a coming-of-age drama (all set in a surrealist Victorian Europe); the story construction was laid out well as the movie had different chapters for the different stops Bella goes on in her journey (and she leaves each stop learning something about humanity and society); the flow between sequences is good as each scene shows a purpose in Bella exploring herself and the world (with her gradually learning more by increasing her vocabulary and thought process); character writing was great as Bella is a very complex character that is initially a blank canvas (with her surrounding characters and experiences painting her into the human she is towards the end of the movie), each of the side characters acts as a central theme of humanity/society and each tries to influence Bella and teach her about the world), Great Screenplay (The dialogue flowed very well as it was tight, profound, and filled with humor (and while the humor wasn't super out there, it was funny and elicited some shock); the tension is built very well in the climax as it is the first time Bellas experiences fear; the movie is filled with symbolism as the whole movie is about humanity and sexuality (with Bella maturing and learning about topics along the way), the movie also shows the impact different ideas can have on corrupting the innocent mind as different characters try to persuade Bella into doing things she does not understand nor wants to do; the foreshadowing is used effectively as it helps show how she is learning from her experiences throughout the movie (and uses them to her advantage when she needs them)), Great Score (Used very well throughout the movie and has a unique charm to add to the quirky/artistic tone of the movie), Great Cinematography (The framed cinematography coupled with the fish-bowl lens help set the tone and feel for the movie (and the close-ups emphasize the characters), Good Sound, Great Editing (Helps with setting the tone and feel for the movie (used well in conjunction with the cinematography)), Very Good Visual Effects (Helped build the surrealist world well as it did create some stunning visuals (at quirky, tacky cost)), Great Production Design (Helped with setting the tone for this doll house, Victorian Europe), Very Good Makeup (Did a very good job at showing how much of a monster Dafoe's character looks like, and why society mocks him for how he looks), Very Good Costumes (Used well with setting the tone and separating the high society with Bella's surrealist look at the world), Plot Structure was laid out well as the movie is set up into chapters based on the different stops she goes on (with each stop being a place where she learns something new); the Paris arc of the plot felt pretty dragged out and could have been cut in half as it got pretty repetitive, Pacing was very slow as the movie becomes repetitive at times (which helps show Bella's learning process); the runtime could have been cut 20 minutes to make the movie a bit tighter (especially in the Paris arc), Climax was executed well as it shows a culmination of what Bella has been learning and how she is finally getting scared of the world, Tone was very Victorian mixed with surrealism and comedy (something that is similar to 'The Favourite'). Overall, a well-executed, unique take on the coming-of-age dramedy as the direction, writing, and acting (especially Emma Stone's performance) all come together to show the impact society has on an individual as Bella is a blank canvas painted by the people she interacts with, though the movie does drag at points and could have been cut to make it tighter.",2023.0,12/22/2023,397.0,tt14230458
Maestro,6.2,"Decent Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good as the exposition pays homage to the 1950s Golden Age of Hollywood, and the scenes afterward feel very polished and grand to show how larger than life Leonard Bernstein was; the direction on a microscale was a mess as a lot of the interpersonal scenes felt discombobulated as everyone was talking at the same time and the desired emotions were not achieved; the direction of actors was good as the performances were elevated and there was a sense of chemistry (it is just the scenes where the characters interact are not that well executed); the storytelling was not good as you do not know what the purpose of this movie is (you do not really learn anything about Leonard Bernstein or his relationship with his Felicia)), Good to Very Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Carey Mulligan (Shows emotion and the impact her relationship with Bernstein had on her, feels very limited by where she can go due to the material), Very Good from Bradley Cooper (Really transforms into Bernstein and does a very good job at showing the different sides of him (both in his youth and when he is old)), Good from the rest of the cast (Do a good job in portraying the time and making the two leads look good)), Bad Story (The concept is ultimately the worst part of the movie because there is a lack of focus on what they want to portray (the intent was to show the relationship between Leonard and Felicia, but you don't really learn anything about the two as it spends more time on how he is cheating on her with men; you don't learn anything about Leonard Bernstein as it just crams in so much information about his life); the plot structure was bad as the movie spends too much time on the exposition (and how great of a relationship the two main characters had) that it does not leave any time to show the turmoil they have (the movie also just focus on unnecessary parts that the conflict is never really introduced, explained, or dealt with), the movie also has a very anticlimatic ending; flow between sequences was good as the movie does flow well (it is just its storytelling that makes it feel like nothing is happening); character writing is very poor as the movie just focuses on the wrong parts of each of the characters (the movie cares more about sharing how Leonard Berstein was gay and cheating on his wife with men than to actually show the relationship he had with Felicia or how important of a figure Berstein was for 20th century American music, and the movie does not really show how much Felicia cared for Berstein (only showing some scenes where she felt trapped))), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was well written and mimicked the time it was portraying (though it does not feel very profound at all, especially in moments where it should be); the humor was very corny and slapstick; tension is not built up well as there isn't any moment I felt engaged with what was going on; the symbolism felt very forced for a biopic and did not do a good job with helping portray the messages of the movie (if there are any); the foreshadowing was pretty non-existent), Pretty Good Score (Pays homage to the work of Leonard Bernstein and incorporated decently well into the movie), Very Good Cinematography (The first half does a great job in emulating the Golden Age of Hollywood, the second half feels polished and more contemporary (the Mahler scene was shot very well)), Pretty Bad Sound (The music was too loud and not properly mixed with the dialogue), Good to Very Good Editing (The editing in the first half of the movie is so seamless and does a great job at paying homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood, the second half just feels very generic (but still polished)), Good Production Design (Helps with portraying the time period, the places where Berstein worked, and his private life), Incredible Makeup (Used incredibly well to transform Bradley Cooper into Leonard Berstein across his entire life (with them looking identical in the composer's later years)), Pacing was all over the place as the beginning felt a bit slow (but fine) and the second half felt incredibly fast that nothing was going on; the movie could have benefited from 30-40 minutes of runtime to emphasize the relationship between Leonard and Felicia because it did not feel like it spent any time on this (when it was the main focus of the movie), Climax was nonexistent because the movie ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger (at least it feels like that); there are 12 minutes of credits and all of these twelve minutes could have been used to help buttress the ending, Tone emulated the time period they were portraying (the 50s in the beginning and the 70s towards the end), This was the most Oscar-bait movie of the year and it really shows; Tár honestly does a better job at what this movie was going for. Overall, a disappointing sophomore effort by Bradley Cooper as his performance cannot save his movie as it falters from a lack of focus on what it wants to portray as you do not really learn anything about Leonard Bernstein or his relationship with Felicia Montealegre.",2023.0,12/24/2023,398.0,tt5535276

Overall, an enjoyable Christmas movie that is carried by its writing and performances as we get to see the unique concept of multiple storylines happening in parallel with their common goal of finding love, though it is a bit bloated from having too many subplots and suffers from many Rom-Com and early 2000s cliches.",2003.0,12/24/2023,399.0,tt0314331

The Zone of Interest,7.0,"Pretty Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale was good as he did a good job in building the world of this dream house next to Auschwitz (and showing the juxtaposition between the two); the direction on a microscale was decent as he does move the plot forward (but in a very experimental/slice-of-life way); the direction of actors is pretty good as not one performance feels like it outshines another, rather everyone is a part in capturing what is going on; the storytelling was kinda an issue as there isn't too much plot and the slice of life style got annoying/boring at times, the experimental non-sequitur shots were very traditional to his style (but I still didn't like them)); he builds tension very well as he uses sound, score, cinematography, and the subject matter to portray the atrocities of the holocaust (and this was especially done well during the night vision scenes)), Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Christian Friedel (He was really a subject rather than a character as we see the SS's perspective told from his eyes/scenes), Pretty Good to Good from Sandra Hüller (Did a pretty good job in showing how attached she was to the house and how oblivious she was to what is going on next door), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Every actor did their part in being a subject in the movie (rather than a character))), Decent Story (The concept was very interesting as it helped show the lack of empathy the subjects had as they tried to build this dream house next to one of the worst concentration camps in the Holocaust; the plot structure was simple and was constructed that way (though the climax did have is issues), the runtime was kinda a mess because a lot of the scenes feel like they were stalling and the movie ends abruptly because the movie is only an hour and 45 minutes; flow between sequences is very stiff as the experimental style really prevented it from being smooth (especially during the experimental scenes); the character writing was decent as you saw who had empathy for what is going and who is completely oblivious to the torture they were committing), Decent Screenplay (The dialogue was very minimal and got really on-the-nose at points; the symbolism was incredibly profound as it relies a lot on juxtaposition to show how the subjects are oblivious to the horrors of Auschwitz by building this dream house next door (though it got really repetitive/forced at times), I respect them not showing any of the atrocities of Auschwitz as it helps symbolize how oblivious the family was to what was going on; the foreshadowing was kinda nonexistent are there really wasn't any plot to foreshadow (plus it is a historical drama so they could only do too much)), Decent to Pretty Good Score (Used well in helping build tension, but nonexistent otherwise), Decent Cinematography (Relies heavily on wide-angle shots to tell the movie (so cinematography, for the most part, is a stylistic choice rather than a benefit); the night vision shots were kinda out of place and a bit too experimental for my liking, though the symbolism from these scenes was good in portraying some humanity in the world (and how it backfires)), Great Sound (The horrors from the camp are dialed in at the right volume as it is so quiet yet so deafening at the same time), Bad Editing (Just aids to this experimental style that I did not like because it took away from the flow and just felt very awkward at times), Very Good Production Design (A key component for the story as it shows the juxtaposition between the house and the camp right next door), Pretty Good Costumes (Helped with establishing the time and subject matter), Pacing is incredibly slow (so much that it is just kinda painful to go through the plot, which kinda helps with the message), Climax was incredibly anticlimactic as it tried hard to be symbolic but ended up just being a bit too experimental and caused the movie to end abruptly, Tone is incredibly similar to 'Under the Skin' in how experimental it was (but it still had themes from the time period/subject), This is basically Juxtaposition: The Movie. Overall, a movie that, as a symbol, is profound since it uses juxtaposition well to get its message across, but, as a watchable movie, it has way too much of an experimental style for my liking.",2023.0,01/14/2024,406.0,tt7160372

Overall, a pretty good Telugu movie that blends comedy and drama well to create a superhero epic that alludes to Hindhu literature, though the movie borrows a lot of tropes and filmmaking techniques from both Telugu cinema and superhero movies.",2024.0,01/22/2024,407.0,tt15433956

We Bought a Zoo,4.1,"Bad Direction (The direction on a macroscale feels incredibly late 00s/early 10s with its feel-good tone and its animal montages; the direction on a microscale is very bad as it never felt like there was a focus or goal with any of the scenes and the interpersonal scenes were more laughable than deep; the direction of actors is very bad because most of the line delivery in the movie is off, and it never felt like any chemistry was built in the cast; the storytelling was very similar to other Cameron Crowe movies (which meant it was very feel-good and predictable), and had a lot of flavors of other family movies from the time-period; there was one moment in the movie where they try to build tension, but it is very short and anti-climatic that it made me question what was the purpose of the scene), Bad to Pretty Bad Acting (Bad from Matt Damon (Had very bad line-delivery throughout the entire movie, felt comedic when he was supposed to be dramatic, and never built chemistry with any of the cast), Bad from Scarlett Johansson (Her line delivery and tone throughout the movie just feels off-beat), Pretty Bad from Thomas Haden Church (Plays a similar character to the one he played in 'Sideways' (but does not have chemistry with Matt Damon as he had with Paul Giamatti)), Decent from Colin Ford (Child actor who has some good moments throughout the movie), Decent from Elle Fanning (Child actor who develops some chemistry with Ford), Decent from Maggie Elizabeth Jones (Child actor who portrays the innocence of the situation), Pretty Bad from Patrick Fugit (Just feels like he is in this movie because he worked with Crowe in the past), Decent from John Michael Higgins (The only adult performance that didn't feel terrible because he portrays the character's antagonistic qualities well), Bad from the rest of the cast (Does not include the child actors; it feels like every performance was off-beat as the line delivery and inflection never made sense)), Very Bad Story (The concept was so dumb (even if it was based on a true story), and to make things worse, they made the movie incredibly feel good that it sucked any ounce of realism; the plot structure is incredibly formulaic and predictable (they could've even cut 30 minutes out of the movie and it would've been the same thing), the b-storyline about the protagonist grieving over his wife feels very shallow and under-developed; the flow between shots and sequences feels incredibly rigid with a forced plot; the character writing is boilerplate with no deviation (making their character arcs incredibly predictable)), Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is dumb and unnatural (so bad that it was just funny to comprehend how this was the final draft); the humor is just so forced/filled with dad humor (and was not funny at all); the symbolism was so overt that it was laughable (with the movie basically being a giant symbol for acceptance in the mourning process); the foreshadowing in the movie just made the movie even more predictable), Pretty Bad Score (Just feels like royalty-free music throughout the movie), Pretty Good Cinematography (Even though there are some generic shots, the wildlife shots are captured well), Decent Sound, Pretty Bad Editing (Feels very choppy and typical to movies from the period), Pretty Good Visual Effects (More about the practical effects because I did respect them using real animals because they were well trained and were an integral part of the movie), Decent Production Design (They bought the zoo), Pacing is very slow as the movie just feels like it drags through its predictable plot (they could've cut 30-40 minutes out and it would've been the same movie), Climax is incredibly anti-climatic because of how short and predictable it is, Tone is incredibly feel-good/family movie (with many flavors to other Cameron Crowe movies), This movie is just so memable that it is worth a watch (especially the fight about 'The Dream'). Overall, an incredibly formulaic movie because it feels like Cameron Crowe put no effort into directing or writing this movie and instead tried to make the most feel-good/family movie ever, but it is still watchable because of how memable it is.",2011.0,02/16/2024,414.0,tt1389137
Madame Web,2.1,"Terrible Direction (The direction on a macroscale was terrible because they did such a bad job at building the world and establishing the conflict (they just forced what time period the movie took place); the direction on a microscale was atrocious as the whole movie was incredibly monotonous and all of the interpersonal scenes were just laughable bad (especially towards the end); the direction of actors was terrible because all the performances were incredibly monotonous and there was no chemistry in the entire cast; the storytelling was unfocused as she had no idea where she wanted to take this movie, it felt like they were telling the story while the script was still being made; she forces the tension so much that you don't care what happens to the characters; the cut for this movie was incredibly bad because it felt like they tried to Frankenstein a film on bad footage), Very Bad Acting (Very Bad from Dakota Johnson (Shows that she is nepotism personified as I have never seen someone put as little effort into a lead performance as her; her whole character is incredibly monotonous that it rubs off on all the other actors; she is so useless in the action scenes that it makes me wonder why even make a movie on Madame Web; she has no chemistry with the rest of the cast; her performance wasn't terrible because she does have some moments that were fine, but most of these are in the exposition), Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (Her character is given nothing to work with as it is obvious she is trying to make something with what she has, but in the end, it is clear that the script is just too bad to put in a decent performance), Pretty Bad to Decent from Isabela Merced (She shows as much charisma and timing that the writing can let her), Very Bad to Bad from Celeste O'Connor (Mostly just annoying because her performance just felt so forced), Terrible from Tahar Rahim (Might be one of the worst performances in a big budget movie I have ever seen as his accent and tone were just so off that it made me cringe whenever he was on screen; not menacing at all because his character is just so poorly written; has no chemistry with any of the cast (especially Dakota Johnson)), Pretty Bad from Mike Epps (Comedic relief for like 5 minutes), Pretty Bad from Emma Roberts (Just plays herself for like 5 minutes), Pretty Bad to Decent from Adam Scott (Feels like Robin Williams compared to the rest of the cast as he has decent comedic timing and tries to establish as much chemistry with Dakota Johnson as he can), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (All the extras/side-characters feel like this was their first job)), Terrible Story (The concept is just so stupid because none of what was going on felt interesting, and the conflict makes no sense because it feels forced; the plot structure was pretty formulaic, but the main issue is that the plot elements make no sense and are incredibly forced; there are many plot holes and continuity issues; flow between sequences is terrible because it feels like they forcing are where the plot is going to go; the character writing is some of the worst I have ever seen for a comic book as Madame Web is the most boring/uninteresting superhero I have ever seen, and the villain is so poorly written because his origin makes no sense and his conflict just feels so forced; the movie has this weird relationship with the Spider-man franchise because they tried so hard to show that it's in the universe, but as the same time subvert any reference they try to make), Terrible Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious as none of what was said made sense (it felt like the script was written by an 8th grader whose homework was to write a superhero script), notable lines being 'you did it, you did it' and 'every day that goes by, my appointment with death comes closer'; the humor is so dry and forced that it was funnier when they were trying to be serious (making this a contender to be a fun bad movie); the symbolism is so overt because they try to push this concept of the family so hard, but the movie is just so bad that you don't care; foreshadowing is a key plot element for this movie as the visions help predict what was going to happen, but the issue is this element is saturated throughout the movie and it is sometimes not clear what is a vision and what is actually happening), Bad Score (The score was pretty formulaic and was just so poorly used/mixed in), Bad Cinematography (More polished than Morbious, but is still very bad in the fight scenes as they try to do so much), Terrible Sound (The ADR was atrocious as there were moments where dialogue was said without mouths moving; I genuinely feel that they hated all the footage they shot, but it was so expensive to reshoot that they tried to make the most with what they could), Terrible Editing (The number of fast cuts is nauseating as it made the movie not coherent; the way they only sometimes differentiated what was a vision and what was the present made the movie unnecessarily confusing), Very Bad Visual Effects (Over-saturated and looks incredibly fake), Very Bad Production Design (Everything looks like it's on a blue-screen), Decent Makeup, Decent Costumes (They have costumes for less than a minute just so they could use it in the promos), Pacing is pretty slow as they try so hard to make it feel longer than it needed to be (and the visions/sharp edits disrupted this flow so much that it was a chore to get through this movie); the runtime could have been cut 30 minutes and the movie still would have been a nightmare, Climax is so poorly constructed because it felt like it was directed by Michael Bay from Temu with how they excessively used visual effects (and felt so forced with its character revelations), Tone is a big issue for this movie because they tried to make a fun superhero movie (but everyone's tone is just so monotonous that this never comes into fruition), The old man obnoxiously snoring next to me showed more emotion than the entire cast of this movie. Overall, a terrible movie that makes Argylle seem like Citizen Kane as it feels like they tried to make a watchable movie out of terrible footage, but I got more enjoyment from the man snoring next to me because he showed more emotion than the entire cast.",2024.0,02/16/2024,415.0,tt11057302
The Lobster,7.7,"Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale feels similar to his other movies (but in a pretty toned down way); the direction on a microscale is good because he helps establish the tone and the sense of anxiety with the deadpan and pauses in dialogue; the direction of actors is good because everyone's deadpan acting helped establish their character's social anxiety; the storytelling is pretty standard to both narrated movies and Lanthimos' style; he builds tension decently well as a lot of the moments of silence do bring out some anxiety for both the characters and the audience), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Colin Farrell (Embodies someone with social anxiety and loneliness very well as his deadpan demeanor coupled with his intentional pauses help portray his character), Good from Rachel Weisz (A very experienced actor who has good chemistry with Farrell, while simultaneously shining in her own moments), Pretty Good from Jessica Barden (Her deadpan style helps portray her social anxiety and loneliness well), Pretty Good to Good from Olivia Colman (Shines in her scenes as she establishes a sense of status being the manager of the hotel (something that will be a major key in her next collaboration with Lanthimos)), Pretty Good from Ariane Labed, Pretty Good from Angeliki Papoulia (Helps establish a sense of a pseudo-antagonist with her relationship with Farrell), Pretty Good to Good from John C. Reilly (Shows a good amount of emotion and a sense of desperation in trying to find a partner), Pretty Good from Léa Seydoux (Her monotonous tone helps show how numb she was to loneliness as she was trying to lead her people), Pretty Good to Good from Ben Whishaw (Embodies someone with social anxiety, loss, and loneliness with his lack of emotion and awkward social connection), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone did their job in portraying people with social anxiety and loneliness as there is a lack of connection throughout the cast, leading this to be one of the better portrayals of social anxiety and loneliness)), Pretty Good Story (The concept is a very unique take on social anxiety and loneliness; the plot structure is kinda an issue as the movie focuses way too much on its exposition that it makes the rising action/the second half feel like it is dragging; the runtime could have been cut by like 20 minutes as the movie spends too long at the hotel; flow between sequences is intentionally rigid as it helps portray this disconnect the characters had with each other; character writing is good as it is a pretty accurate portrayal of social anxiety and loneliness, and how far people will go to ease their pain (especially with the main character)), Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue is pretty witty and well written as it helps portray the conflicts people are facing; the humor is very deadpan, and written well as it presented a lot of unintentional shocks and laughs; the symbolism is very prominent throughout the movie as the whole movie can be thought of as a symbol for social anxiety, loneliness, and the quest to ease this pain; the foreshadowing is good as it helps lay roots that will impact the character's actions towards the end), Good Cinematography (A bit more toned down than Lanthimos' other movies, but still pretty European and auter-esque), Pretty Good Sound, Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Helps portray the animals), Good Production Design (Helps portray the hotel and the forest), Pacing is incredibly slow as its deadpan style makes the audience feel uncomfortable the more the movie goes on, Climax is decent as it presents critical choices for the characters to make, Tone was a deadpan take by Lanthimos, This movie feels like if Napoleon Dynamite was made by an auter. Overall, a pretty good film that is a unique take on social anxiety and loneliness with its script and performances, but feels like it drags with its long exposition and deadpan style.",2015.0,02/21/2024,416.0,tt3464902
Dune: Part 2,9.4,"Incredible Direction (The film is brilliant on a macroscale as it provides something more epic than the first, with its vast dunes, gigantic crowds, and colossal battle scenes; the direction on a microscale is great because it is less Sci-fi/formulaic this time as the scenes touch on more messiah/prophecy-like meanings and how this power leads to corruption; the direction of actors is better this time as you really see every performance get elevated as each actor truly feels like they are serving their purpose; the storytelling has tones to both sci-fi epics as well as messiah/prophecy-like stories, and Villeneuve tells these tones on a grand scale; Villeneuve builds tension very well as he uses sound, action, scale, and story to showcase how epic this sequel is, building on everything the first film established), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Timothée Chalamet (For the first half of the movie, it was hard to believe him as Paul Atredies, but after one scene, there is a full 180-degree switch where he fully immerses himself as the Lisan al Gaib and carries the movie to the finish line), Good to Very Good from Zendaya (Plays an integral part in buttressing Chalamet's performance in becoming one with the Freman, and does so by establishing good chemistry between the two; in her solo moments, she shows off in portraying her disbelief in the messiah as she as her character is more of a realist), Very Good from Rebecca Ferguson (Has both motherly and antagonistic characteristics throughout the movie as her character is someone who can simultaneously help and hurt the protagonist, and by the end, she fully immerses herself in her role), Good to Very Good from Josh Brolin (Plays a fatherly figure to Chalamet 's character well and still shows how he is a loyal solider to the House of Atreides), Good to Very Good from Austin Butler (Really embodies that his character is the heir to the Harkonnen throne as he does a good job at being a sociopathic antagonist), Good from Florence Pugh (Really isn't given that much to work with but does a good job at being a central figure in her scenes), Pretty Good from Dave Bautista (Shows status in a lot of his scenes, but he is very over-the-top in a lot of moments, and he isn't given much to work with by the time the climax arrives), Good from Christopher Walken (Literally just plays Christopher Walken), Pretty Good from Léa Seydoux (She's in the movie for like 2 scenes), Good to Very Good from Stellan Skarsgård (Carries over where he left off in the last film as he does a good job in showing the greed of the House of Harkonnen), Very Good to Great from Javier Bardem (The best performance in the movie as you really believe that he is a believer in the Lisan al Gaib prophecy and will do everything he can to help Paul achieve that potential, filling the void Duncan, Leto, and Gurney left in the first film; shows a wide range of emotions and can seamlessly transition from humorous to anger to infatuated in a second), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone does their job as you can see different sides of the spectrum on the belief of Paul as the Lisan al Gaib/Heir to the Atredies throne)), Very Good to Great Story (The concept carries out the intended purpose of the second half of the book as it follows Paul's journey in becoming the Lisan al Gaib (and does so in a way that mixes Sci-Fi elements with religious elements), and the film stays pretty true to the source material and only deviates to better fit the narrative that Villeneuve crafted; the plot structure is great for the most part as the movie itself has its own plot, but also benefits from having there be little needed exposition as that was the intent of the first film (this film picks up right where it's predecessor left off); the main issue with the plot structure/runtime is that the film felt too short as 20-30 minutes could have been added to help slow scenes down and show how epic this movie is (especially in the climax as it feels shorter than it needed to be); flow between sequences is very good as each sequence feels connected to the last (though these sequences could have been slowed down to emphasize the sequence's importance to the story); the character writing is great as you see the impact the conflict has on the characters and how they react (with character's blindly following this prophecy and some even being corrupted by it by taking advantage of this new found power)), Great Screenplay (The dialogue is a lot more polished this time around as it sounds less Sci-Fi heavy and more realistic; the humor is used well throughout the movie (and this is mainly from Stilgar/Javier Bardem's character); the symbolism is incredibly profound as you can see the metaphors to Biblical/Prophecy-like Messiahs aiming to free people, and this movie goes one step further by showing how this power can lead to corruption and losing morals; the foreshadowing is executed well as it helps show this concept of the corruption of power as Paul is scared to be the Lisan al Gaib because of what it might do to his morals, and this also shows the relationship Paul will have with the Freman and the other houses), Great Score (Used very well to build the world and used more to build tension than last time, but it just feels like he reused a lot of the same themes as last time), Brilliant Cinematography (A technical benchmark as the movie is shot entirely in the IMAX, and they use this effectively as it helps show how grand of an epic this movie is, especially in the large crowd scenes and the colossal battles; the coloring/lighting they used in many of the scenes were stunning and rival some of the shots from Blade Runner 2049 (especially in the Gladiator scene and the final fight)), Incredible Sound (Does an amazing job in setting the tone, showing how grand this epic is, and displaying the weight power has on followers (especially from Paul's perspective)), Incredible Editing (Carries off where the previous film left off as it helps show how so many small pieces come together to make this grand epic; Used effectively well in the interpersonal scenes to show how the visions of grandeur affect the characters), Incredible Visual Effects (Helps show how grand the epic is and is seamlessly used amongst the real world, making it feel like you are transported to Arrakis), Great to Incredible Production Design (Continues where it left off as it helps portray the vastness of Arrakis and how grand this movie is with its sets and design; pulls a lot from Ancient Middle Eastern/Egyptian culture to show the beliefs of the characters and how they are waiting for the Lisan al Gaib to save them), Great Makeup (Improves from the last film in helping showcase traditional Sci-Fi elements (like with the blue eyes and the Harkonnen), but feels even more polished this time), Very Good Costumes (Continued where it left off last time), Pacing is a bit too fast as the movie breezes through its runtime by going through as much plot as it can, and this leaves you wanting more because it does not give you enough time to sit with what was going on (I would have liked 20-30 minutes to help slow the pace down), Climax is incredibly grand and the best part of the movie as the whole final hour of the movie feels like everything was clicking as we got to see how grand this epic was with its large-scale fights and sets, but it feels a bit too short and could've benefited from a longer runtime to elongate come of the abrupt fight scenes, Tone is more biblical in nature this time around as you saw the impact the prophecy of the Lisan al Gaib had on the characters, but there are still many scenes where it still has Sci-Fi tones, This movie improved on almost every aspect from the previous film and is setting the groundwork for 'Dune: Messiah' to be even more grand and epic, but even if this was the last movie, I would have been satisfied where they left the movie off; the film being shot in IMAX truly is an achievement in itself and will set the trend for more films to follow; With Oppenheimer, this movie is now making going to the movies in IMAX a true spectacle (as if you were going to a concert). Overall, a technical masterpiece that is led by Villeneuve's vision and groundbreaking technicals because this film sets a new benchmark in cinema as it builds on the trend in making large-scale, IMAX movies an event, but the film is held back from being perfect by its fast pace and too short runtime as you are left wanting more.",2024.0,02/25/2024,417.0,tt15239678

the storytelling is very good as it uses Hanuman and Hinduism to serve as an allegory to lay the blueprint on, and the film uses the personal connection the protagonist has to his mother drive this story forward; the tension is built very well as the protagonist's emotional rage helps fuel the intensity of the fight scenes), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Dev Patel (A true leading man as he displays a wide range of emotions to convey all the feelings he has towards his mother and his past trauma, and he seamlessly transitions between these emotions;

the plot structure is laid out very well as each element felt like the right length and all the scenes built on each other to lead the movie to the climax; the character writing is great as the protagonist is an allegory for Hanuman and he is written holistically to show how his past trauma fuels his revenge, and the character writing for the rest of the cast is good as they fill in roles that are very stereotypical to films in Indian Cinema), Very Good to Great Screenplay (The dialogue is very authentic to Indian Cinema and is very engaging;

Simmons (Still the best performance in the movie as he is given more to work with this time around and pushes the limits at how comedic his character can be), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (The performances are less campy this time around and do a good job at supporting the main cast)), Great Score (Still Iconic), Decent Soundtrack (Super 2000s and kinda disrupts the flow), Very Good Cinematography (Uses improved technology and widescreen to make the movie feel more clear and polished), Very Good Editing (More polished and seamless (but there are still a lot of campy/00s edits that hold it back from being great)), Great Sound (Feel very polished and help bring to life the fight scenes/world (especially in regards to Spider-Man's web-shooting and Doc Oc's mechanical arms)), Great Visual Effects (Uses advanced technology very well to push the bounds of 00s visual effects to make this movie very iconic and groundbreaking (but it is still obvious where they used a blue screen and how far we've come in terms of VFX technology)), Very Good Production Design (Iconic and helps set this comic book version of New York), Good Makeup (Helps show the damage and scars Peter gets from how far he pushes Spider-Man), Great Costumes (The Spider-Man suit is still iconic and the Doc Oc costume is designed very well), Pacing is very good and there is nothing to cut, Climax is executed very well as it is action-packed and gives big revelations about Spider-Man/gives closure to Peter's internal conflict throughout the movie, Tone is less campy and more comic-book/dramatic this time around (but still has its fair share of comedic moments), One of the biggest improvements I have seen from the first to the second movie in a series/trilogy I have ever seen. Overall, a great super-hero movie that is a strong improvement over its predecessor with its acting, writing, and technicals as Sam Raimi pushes this film to the limit to make it one of the most groundbreaking comic-book adaptations of all time.",2004.0,04/23/2024,442.0,tt0316654
Challengers,9.2,"Great Direction (The direction on a macroscale is great as he sets the overarching love triangle conflict well and accurately portrays both the intensity/mine-games of Tennis and various aspects of the organized sport (including the ATP Tour, the US Open series, the challenger circuit, the collegiate level, and the amateur circuit); the direction on a microscale is great as you see the triangle of relationships between the three main characters; the storytelling is great as they do an amazing job jumping between the past and the present to holistically share the match between all three of these characters; he builds tension very well as it mimics the intensity of tennis (especially in the climax/final match)), Incredible Story (The concept is incredible as the movie is really about this love triangle between the three main characters, and tennis is merely a metaphor for how these characters interact with each other; the movie very accurately displays the various levels of organized tennis as well as the intensity/mental game of playing tennis; the plot structure is laid out very well as the movie does a good job in going between the current match and the past to holistically display the relationships between the three characters; character writing is great as you get a sense of the double-edged nature of Tashi's character, the fall from grace for Pat's character, the unreciprocated love for Art's character, and how Tashi is the net between these challengers), Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue is incredible as you see how conversations are a metaphorical tennis rally the way the characters recite lines back and forth to win each conversation, and the tennis vernacular is very accurate to the sport and the different time periods they move across; the symbolism is incredibly profound and prevalent as the movie is a metaphorical game of tennis the way Tashi is the net between these two characters; there is just so much symbolism that all my spoiler thoughts on the symbolism will be in the 'final notes' section; the foreshadowing is incredible as you the way the narrative is structured with it going between the present and the past because elements from the past come back to play a role in the present (especially in the climax)), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Zendaya (Really carries the movie as she acts as the net between the two challengers and shows how she is the one really in control of the match of their lives), Pretty Good from Josh O'Connor (The weakest one out of the main three characters as he is not really on the other two's level, but does hold his own when it counts), Very Good from Mike Faist (Has a lot of charisma and shows genuine concern for Zendaya's character, even though it may not always be reciprocated; does a very good job at matching the levels of his castmates and showing how his character has changed over the years), Decent from the rest of the cast (The movie is really about the main three as everyone else is merely a cameo; the tennis form for the actors is not the best as some either have great footwork but bad technique and vise versa)), Incredible Score (Fits the mood incredibly well as it does an amazing job at establishing the intensity and tension of every scene; their best score since 'The Social Network'), Very Good Cinematography (Does an amazing job of showing all the different angles of tennis (even though the first-person POVs are a bit tacky)), Pretty Bad Editing (While the editing was decent for the most part, there were so many continuity errors/simple blunders that could have easily been fixed in post (like the score on the ticker was wrong many times and there were moments where someone who serving when they should be returning), and it is very baffling these errors made the final cut considering this movie got pushed back more than half a year; the slow motion shots were fine to build tension, but they were overused in the climax), Great Sound (Really good at getting the intensity of tennis and the crisp pop of hitting a tennis ball), Pretty Bad Visual Effects (It made the movie super obvious they were not hitting the tennis balls as the spin/trajectory of the balls never actually matched how they were hit; side note, but there is no way Pat could serve that fast on a half-serve), Great Production Design (Accurately portrays the different time periods of tennis and the US Open series), Pacing is perfect, Climax is incredibly intense as it was the climax for both this close tennis match and the relationships between all of these characters; I enjoyed how the movie is left a bit open-ended as it brings different levels of interpretations on what happened, Tone is really a romantic drama between these three characters and tennis acts as a background/setting, This is one of the most accurate portrayals of tennis I have seen in media (minus how they actually played tennis); there is just so much symbolism for this movie (first: each conversation was a rally, second: Tashi was really the net between these two challengers (but on a more metaphorical level she is an obstacle between these two, so when the net is removed, these two challengers can finally embrace each other), third: the title itself is very symbolic (in the beginning, she adds the 's' to the title, so this is not an ATP Challenger, it is an ATP Challengers as she is trying to live her career vicariously through her husband (so when Art contemplates retirement, she does not know what she wants to do because this is all she knows (she thinks of herself as more than a ball and a racket, but in the end that all she is (and she doesn't know what she'll do with herself once her husband retires, She is clinging onto Pat because he still wants to play tennis and isn't giving up))), fourth: Tashi really is a homewrecker for these two challengers (there are a lot of homosexual undertones for this movie and Tashi is really the net/obstacle that got in the way betwen their friendship/relationship to where they feel free in the end when the obstacle is finally removed)). Overall, a great movie that is carried by incredible writing, an incredible score, great direction, and memorable performances (especially Zendaya's) as the film uses tennis as a metaphor to explain the relationships of this love triangle, but this movie is held back by its noticeable editing/continuity blunders and unrealistic tennis technique.",2024.0,04/26/2024,443.0,tt16426418
Alien,7.8,"Pretty Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good as he builds the  overarching conflict well and uses tension to bring out the horror in the alien and the fear of dying; the direction on a microscale is pretty good as each performance has a part in how they reach to what is going on; the storytelling is good as it progresses through a pretty simple story, and uses tension to heighten the stakes as the conflict unravels), Pretty Good Story (The concept is pretty simple yet effective as the movie boils down to a hide-and-seek with the alien, and the movie does a good job at incorporating a twist to heighten the stakes; the plot structure is pretty simple, but the exposition feels very long; the character writing is pretty good as it fills all the archetypes of a “crew” movie, but also does a good job at providing some depth for Ripley as she tries to do the right thing and navigate through her fear), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue is good and flows well; the symbolism is somewhat prominent as it tackles the concept of capitalism at the expense of human life; the foreshadowing is pretty standard for a horror movie), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Pretty Good from Tom Skerritt (Plays the captain well), Good from Sigourney Weaver (Controls the movie and does a good job at showing her fear and anxiety for what is going on), Pretty Good from Veronica Cartwright, Pretty Good from Harry Dean Stanton, Pretty Good from John Hurt, Pretty Good from Ian Holm, Pretty Good from Yaphet Kotto, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (The cast as a whole is filled with different archetypes for a crew movie and do a good job at reacting differently to the conflict and the alien)), Good Score (Decent themes and helped establish tension and fear (but used more sparingly than I thought it would be)), Great Cinematography (Helps capture the world/ship and show the emotions and fear of the humans as they interact with the alien and conflict), Great Editing (Make the movie feel very polished and used well to elicit horror), Great Sound (Used well to show the fear in the environment and how scary the Alien is), Incredible Visual Effects (Did an incredible job creating the alien and this space world/ship), Incredible Production Design (The space-ship is iconic and they do an amazing job making this a futuristic sci-fi world), Very Good Makeup (Did a good job in showing the impact and byproduct of the aliens), Pacing is very slow in the first hour as it feels like the movie is dragging through exposition, but, even though they pick up the pace, the movie still feels somewhat slow in the second half, Climax is executed well as it shows the true carnage from the Alien and how afraid the crewmates are (but still feels a bit slow), Tone is a mix of multiple genres (sci-fi, horror, and action). Overall, an iconic horror film that is a major influence for the sci-fi genre as the movie does a pretty good job playing hind-and-seek with this mysterious Alien, even though it can be slow at times.",1979.0,04/28/2024,444.0,tt0078748
Spider-Man 3,6.7,"Decent Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good as these are the highest budgeted action sequences, but it was very obvious this was a 3D movie (and it hasn't aged well); the direction on a microscale is a step back from the previous movie as the actors do not feel elevated, and the deeper concepts get muddled with the rest of the plot; the storytelling is a mess as the movie tries to tell so much in so little time; he builds tension well (but a step back from the previous movie as you know what is coming)), Bad Story (The plot is not that great because it introduces too many characters, it has 3 villains and a new love interest, and only increases the runtime by 10 minutes, so the structure is just mismanaged and breezes through plot points; the character writing is a step back because it introduces too many characters and does not provide any depth to them), Decent Screenplay (The dialogue is corny again as it is filled with many memeable lines (which also does make this movie iconic); the humor is unintentionally funny again because the movie reverted to being campy (enter Bully Maguire); the symbolism is there because the movie does tackle deep themes like arrogance, selfishness, and love, but not on a deeper level like the previous movie; the foreshadowing is pretty good), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Tobey Maguire (A step back from the previous movie as he goes back to being campy/memey since he can really only show arrogance and anger (Bully Maguire); his performance is still memorable because he still has an aura that represents what the Sam Raimi trilogy is), Good from Kirsten Dunst (The only improvement from the last film as she is given more to work with MJ's increased depth), Pretty Good from James Franco (Shows that he is a good actor, but he is given nothing to work with because Harry is nerfed and forced in this movie), Pretty Bad from Thomas Haden Church (A very monotonous performance, but he does show emotion when talking about his backstory), Pretty Bad from Topher Grace (Such a fun, over-the-top performance that emulates what this movie is; he is not a good Venom), Decent from Bryce Dallas Howard (Kinda forced into this movie and does not really have chemistry with Maguire), Decent from James Cromwell (Isn't really given much to work with), Good from Rosemary Harris (Still plays the motherly figure well and carries the interpersonal scenes with Maguire), Very Good from J.

Overall, a noticeable step back from the previous films as Sam Raimi tries to do much at once, but the film is still enjoyable with how campy and memey it is (like Bully Maguire).",2007.0,04/30/2024,445.0,tt0413300

Miller (Pretty good sidekick to Deadpool), Decent to Pretty Good from Brianna Hildebrand (Plays the teenager role well, but is given less to work with this time around), Pretty Good to Good from Karan Soni (Given more to work with as his Indian comedic relief really has more of a part in the comedy as it helps juxtapose the bad-ass nature of Deadpool), Decent from the rest of the cast (No one feels really outstanding, but everyone plays their part)), Pretty Good Score, Good Cinematography (Used well to give the action sequences personality), Very Good Editing (Feels very crisp and helps make this movie feel unique), Very Good Sound, Decent Visual Effects (Feels a bit oversaturated), Very Good Costumes (Deadpool's costume is very iconic, as it stays really true to the comic books), Pacing is pretty good as they use comedy to slow things down, Climax is a typical comic book ending, but mixed with a lot of humor; the post-credit scene basically removes whatever they were trying to build and feels very unnecessary, Tone is very metacomedy mixed with superhero movie, making it uniquely Deadpool. Overall, a very good sequel that is funnier than the first, as it feels like they were playing with house money when they made this movie, but it reverts back to being a traditional superhero movie with its linear structure and shallow character writing.",2018.0,07/23/2024,471.0,tt5463162

Overall, an entertaining return for Deadpool & Wolverine as the humor and chemistry between the two leads establish their metacomedic entrance into the MCU and send off a love-letter to 20th Century Fox, but this ultimately holds this movie back a bit because it is not focused on which narrative they want to tell.",2024.0,07/25/2024,473.0,tt6263850

Overall, a poorly executed thriller that suffers from being censored by its PG-13 rating as it shallowly treads water without ever going in deep, but ""Trap"" is so stupidly bad that it's entertaining at times.",2024.0,08/06/2024,476.0,tt26753003

Overall, a bad movie as the creative conflict between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni really seeps onto the screen because the movie does not know if it wants to be this cutesy rom-com or a serious drama about a serious topic; while the latter is somewhat executed well, the former is just so cringey and bad that the movie just feels like a larger budget Lifetime movie.",2024.0,08/31/2024,482.0,tt10655524

Overall, DreamWorks takes a positive step as I admire their unique animation style and the way the filmmakers address complex themes of morality, relationships, and adolescence through emotionally charged storytelling; but I feel that it is really held back by its plot construction, as the movie has such an cathartic climax towards the middle point of the movie that the actual climax does not feel as fulfilling.",2024.0,09/23/2024,487.0,tt29623480

the storytelling is a lot less innovative as last time as they really don't subvert your expectations because the movie just goes through the progressions; the use of music and musical numbers to help tell the story was not that strong as it really only hurt the movie by moving away from what was going on; they build tension well as they still use score and cinematography to help with this, but it feels like this is just using experience from the last film), Bad Story (The concept is not that great; it is not that original, and really just feels like a cash grab; the movie does not really provide anything new to these characters and just shows why there should not have been a sequel; the idea of having this be a jukebox musical really kinda backfired in the end because it did not feel like it was executed well and took away from the charm of the first movie; the plot structure is way more linear this time around and pretty predictable, with the interjections in musical numbers being the only thing that deviates from the linear structure; the character writing is not that great this time around as it does not provide any additional depth to Arthur Fleck; it honestly makes his character worse as they took away a lot from what made the character interesting in the first film, and Lee really just feels like an uninteresting interpretation of Harley Quinn; this story really hurts the first movie as the predecessor no longer has an open-for-interpretation ending), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue is alright for the most part, but has a lot of corny and cringey lines that really stand out and make the movie feel pretentious; the humor is not as strong this time around, but does have some noteworthy moments; there are so many illusions and homages in this movie as the movie references like 'Singing in the Rain' and 'Psycho' while also referencing important historical trials like Ted Bundy and Billy Milligan, but it does so in a little too overt manner at times; the symbolism is not as strong as the previous movie as there really isn't anything to take away from this movie; the foreshadowing is not as strong as the first movie as they really plant seeds that never come out, kinda subverting our expectations by being predictable this time around), Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Joaquin Phoenix (Uses a lot of his experience from playing to role to help define this character and feels like he never left in the more dramatic scenes, but does not really hold his own well in the musical numbers;  does not have the best chemistry with Lady Gaga; does not feel like he was given as much runway to work with this time around), Good from Lady Gaga (Does very well in the music numbers and holds her own well; is not really given that much material to really show off and stand alone outside of Phoenix's performance; does not have the best chemistry with Phoenix), Good from Brendan Gleeson (Has a surprisingly charismatic performance and has good chemistry with Phoenix), Pretty Good to Good from Catherine Keener (Plays her role well and has good chemistry with Phoenix), Pretty Good from Zazie Beetz (Really just a cameo), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Supports the main cast well and shows the different faces of Gotham)), Very Good Score (Still has a lot of the same themes as the first movie and is still used to create tension, it is just used way less than the first movie), Decent Soundtrack (The song selection was pretty good; it is just the musical numbers were pretty hit or miss; I enjoyed the grand dance sequence numbers that felt like non-sequiturs, but felt like the singing in the middle of scenes really took away from the film), Incredible Cinematography (The best part of the movie, as I felt, was the cinematography; it really painted the screen with stunning visuals and was effectively used to display imagery to make this movie feel like an art piece; Some of my favorite shots were the 'Singing in the Rain' reference, the pills making a smile, the smile with the lipstick on the glass, and the courtroom scene where Arthur is out of focus but you see his face looking at the audience from the video-camera screen; The use of IMAX shots was done well as this was mostly used to show grand sequences, inside Arthur's mind, or the musical numbers; The color grading was really nice in helping show the dark, colorless side of Gotham), Great Editing (Used very well in conjunction with the cinematography to make this movie visually appealing and an art piece), Very Good Sound (Used well to build tension and show some of the action sequences; the constant laughing and distant sounds in the background really helped us feel like we are inside Arthur's mind as he constantly hears thoughts), Good Visual Effects (Helped paint the world of Gotham; the pyrotechnics and practice effects felt fine, but not that surprising), Very Good Production Design (Really enjoyed how they created Gotham (basically New York City) and Arkham Asylum; really enjoyed some of the sets for the musical scenes as they felt like they paid homage to the 50s and 60s; the production design as a whole did not feel as amazing/iconic as the last movie), Very Good Makeup (Helped paint and create the Joker and Harley Quinn), Very Good Costumes (Helped paint and create the Joker and Harley Quinn), Pacing was good for the most part, as the movie felt like it was getting through a lot of plot in such a short runtime; the climax could have been cut a little, The climax was poorly executed, as it felt like it did not end the movie well, as it felt like nothing interesting happened; the sequel was definitely more straightforward and not as iconic or innovative as the first movie, Tone is not good as it tries to be a musical while simultaneously trying to be an auteur-driven psychological thriller; the former really hurts the intentions of the latter as it does neither very well, I really felt like this movie wasn't necessary going into the movie and I feel this way even more after watching the movie; this movie just feels like a cash grab as it does not provide anything new or interesting to the universe; the idea of having a sequel really hurts the open-ended nature of the first movie and kinda makes it worse in retrospect. Overall, a clear cash grab as this movie does not provide anything new or interesting to the universe and ruins the unique, open-ended brilliance of 'Joker'; but it is a decent watch for its cinematography, visuals, technicals, and acting.",2024.0,09/30/2024,489.0,tt11315808
Piece by Piece,7.5,"Pretty Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is unique and interesting as they basically had a narratively driven documentary about Pharrell's life but told it through Legos, and used the Lego animation well to help paint the world and show Pharrell's imagination; the direction on a microscale feels like an interview-style documentary, though Pharrell is given space to work with and share his emotions; the storytelling is very similar to other documentaries, though told in a very meta, creative style), Pretty Good Story (The concept is really interesting as it is an interview-style documentary on Pharrell's life, but told through the lens of Lego animation; this movie opens the possibilities of what stories we can tell through Lego Animation; the plot structure follows many interview-style documentaries on a subject's life, but it puts a little too much weight in the wrong places that it feels like it runs out of steam towards the end; it is pretty unclear what is actually factual and what is made up for the movie; the present-day conflict between Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams makes the movie have somewhat of an awkward tension between the two characters; the character writing does not really do a great job at showing the ego of Pharrell because they mention it but kind of brush over it, but it does a good job painting how creative he was; the story feels a little biased because it was clear Pharrell had a big say in what was in this movie, and how his side was presented), Decent Screenplay (The dialogue is very meta and kinda pretentious at times, but besides that, it feels like any other documentary; the humor is pretty good, with them making a lot of jokes that push the rating limit; the symbolism is decent as the movie is a metaphor on how pieces come together to make bigger concepts and aspects of life, why they decided to make this movie with Legos; they try to have this political message towards the end of the movie, but there is barely any time left and they kinda just brush over it, so it felt like they had it just to have it without presenting any nuance; the foreshadowing is alright, but kinda predictable if you know Pharrell's life), Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Pharrell Williams (He just plays himself as this is more of a documentary than a narrative; but it definitely shows his personality), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (Really just interviews from people in Pharrell's life and people he worked with)), Good Score (Helped show Pharrell's personality, and incorporated many of his iconic themes and beats), Very Good Soundtrack (Basically, a Pharrell Williams Greatest Hits album, and it had different songs that influenced his childhood), Good Editing, Good Sound (Incorporated both the music and Lego sound effects well), Great Animation (Loved the animation, as it opens up the doors for what stories we can tell with Legos), Pacing is not the best, as it feels like it places too much weight on his childhood and early days, that the movie runs out of steam towards the end, The climax is not that well executed as the movie feels like it kind of runs out of steam towards the last 20 minutes; but there is some closure, The tone is very documentary in style, with Lego animation flavors. Overall, a pretty good movie that opens the possibilities of what stories we can tell through Lego Animation; but, it is basically a biased documentary on Pharrell Williams' life.",2024.0,10/03/2024,490.0,tt31064841
Saturday Night,7.4,"Pretty Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale emblemates the fast-paced chaos that ensued 90 minutes before the airing of the first SNL show, showing all the hoops that needed to be jumped through to get it to air; the direction on a microscale is a bit chaotic as you are never given enough time to really sit with and care for these characters, but this is kinda intentional; the storytelling uses the goal of airing SNL to help drive the story as you see the story progress to this moment, in a very fast-paced chaotic way; tension is built pretty well using the fast-paced nature of the movie and how chaotic the subject is), Good Story (The concept is really interesting as the movie is a 1-to-1 mapping of the 90 minutes before airing the first episode of SNL; the plot structure is laid out well as the movie runtime is a 1-to-1 mapping of the 90 minutes before air, and it uses time well to help build tension as it slowly goes closer to air-time; character writing is pretty good as you get a scene of who these famous SNL Players are, who is behind the scenes at SNL, and how Lorne Michaels' ambition helps drive this production; there were for sure some things that were made up/rearranged to help make this movie, especially some of the scenes towards the end), Good Screenplay (The dialogue is good, fast-paced, and emblematic of the times; the humor is good as it feels very mature, 70s, and similar to SNL from this era; the symbolism is somewhat there, with references to Prometheus and the bulletin; the foreshadowing is somewhat present, but if you know that SNL is on its 50th season now, you can kinda predict how it ends), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Gabriel LaBelle (He holds his own and controls the movie, but he just looks way too young to play this role because Lorne Michaels was 31 when SNL aired and LaBelle is 22; he does not have great chemistry with Sennott, but is decent with the rest of the cast), Decent from Rachel Sennott (It is fine, but she never really separates herself from the rest of the cast and has very neutral chemistry with LaBelle), Pretty Good from Cory Michael Smith (Portrays Chevy Chase well), Decent from Ella Hunt, Pretty Good from Dylan O'Brien (Portrays Dan Aykroyd well), Pretty Good from Matt Wood (Feels like a carbon copy of John Belushi), Pretty Good from Lamorne Morris (He shows charisma in his performance), Pretty Good from Kim Matula (Held her own and builds chemistry well), Decent from Finn Wolfhard (Feels like a cameo and only in this movie because of his name and previous experience with Reitman), Pretty Good to Good from Nicholas Braun (Plays the double role well as there are stark differences between the two characters, and he does his best to portray both iconic characters), Pretty Good from Cooper Hoffman (Looks a little too young for the role, but does a pretty good job and has good chemistry with LaBelle), Pretty Good from Andrew Barth Feldman (Feels like he is playing the same character from ""No Hard Feelings"" and I am here for it), Decent from Kaia Gerber, Pretty Good to Good from Tommy Dewey (He has charisma in his scenes and really steals the room), Pretty Good from Willem Dafoe (Feels like a generic Dafoe performance, so pretty good), Pretty Good from Matthew Rhys (Enjoyed his portrayal of Carlin, but felt he was underutilized), Pretty Good from J. K. Simmons (He steals the scenes he is in and shows his experience but is not really in the movie that long), Decent from the rest of the cast (So much chaos that the background characters are never given enough time to actually plant themselves in the story, but they do a good job showing this chaos behind the scenes)), Decent Score (Sets the time period and tension), Good Cinematography (Helps show how everything is moving and Michael's viewpoint), Pretty Good Editing (Feels very 1970s and helps piece together this mishmash of story; though some of the edits felt kind of amateur), Pretty Good Sound (Feels emblematic of the times), Decent Visual Effects (A lot of practical effects), Good Production Design (It shows the Rockefeller Center and the SNL set), Pretty Good Makeup, Pretty Good Costumes (Feels emblematic of the times and costumes used in the first SNL episode), Pacing is incredibly fast to show the chaos before the first SNL taping; but because of this, so much plot gets shoved in and you do not have time to sit with any of these characters; I am fine with this tradeoff, Climax is a little forced and predictable; SNL has been on air for 50 seasons; you can guess what happens in the end, Tone feels like a better executed ""Steve Jobs"" as it uses the entire time for this launch and plays into a lot of the humor strengths of SNL. Overall, a pretty good movie that uses its concept of capturing the last 90 minutes before the first SNL episode airing well, as it is a fast-paced, chaotic ride that is really entertaining; but its fast pace does not allow time for you to connect with the characters, and it is pretty evident where they made things up.",2024.0,10/11/2024,491.0,tt27657135
Howl's Moving Castle,7.7,"Pretty Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is very grand and beautiful as his signature style creates this stunning world; the direction on a microscale is fine, pretty typical to other Ghibli movies; the storytelling feels more linear thsi time around as there is a clear story arc), Good Story (The concept is good as the movie is a allegory for the US invasion of Iraq, though it is a bit overt at times about it; the plot structure is laid out well as the movie is pretty linear; flow between sequences is; character writing is good as you do care for these characters and what they want, especially Sophie and Howl), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue is pretty good and standard, for English Dub; the humor keeps the movie pretty light-hearted; the symbolism is evident as the movie is a giant allegory for the US invasion of Iraw, even though it can be a bit overt at times; the foreshadowing is decently prevelant), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Emily Mortimer, Pretty Good from Jean Simmons, Decent to Pretty Good from Christian Bale (Holds his own as Howl, but feels like he has the same tone throughout the movie; shows glimpses as Batman), Decent from Lauren Bacall, Decent to Pretty Good from Billy Crystal (Mike Wazowski), Decent to Pretty Good from Josh Hutcherson (Plays the child role well), Decent from the rest of the cast (For English Dub; Typical background voice actors)), Great Score (Helps make this movie feel very Ghibli and feel like an art-piece; great in its own-right outside of the film), Good Editing (Makes the movie feel polished and like an art-piece), Pretty Good Sound (Typical Ghibli sound), Great Animation (The movie is visually stunning and shows why Miyazaki and Ghibli are key influences for bringing eastern animation to the western world), Pacing is pretty good for the most part, slows down a bit towards the end, Climax is the best as it feels kinda forced to be feel-good, an issue I have with a lot of Ghibli movies, Tone is very similiar to other Ghibli movies, Watched English Dub. Overall, a pretty good movie that uses stunning Ghibli animation to create an allegory about the US invasion of Iraq, but the movie is held back by its ending being too safe and feel-good.",2004.0,10/11/2024,492.0,tt0347149
The Apprentice,4.4,"Bad Direction (The direction on a macroscale is not good as it never feels like they established what tone they want for this movie, though I did enjoy the use of cinematography; the direction on a microscale is bad as the interpersonal scenes feel still and full of inexperience/bad dialogue; the storytelling is pretty good in some areas when the story is interesting, but is not good overall as the movie cannot decide on what story it wants to tell), Bad Story (The concept is not well defined as it is supposed to be a movie about the relationship between Cohn and Trump; and while it does explore this relationship well in the first hour, the movie transitions into being a Trump biopic for the final 40 minutes; the plot structure is pretty bad as the movie does not know which story it wants to tell; the character writing is bad as it does a very bad job showing how Trump transitions into the egotistical businessman he was molded into, it just happens), Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is very overt and poorly written; the humor is funny because of how bad the dialogue is written, feels like it was written by someone who used Google Translate; the symbolism is alright, but not as profound as it is trying to be because it has no nuance and is incredibly overt; the foreshadowing is pretty predictable), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Pretty Good from Sebastian Stan (His mannerisms and delivery as young Trump are uncanny; does not have good chemistry with the cast), Decent to Pretty Good from Jeremy Strong (A little exaggerated of a performance, but definitely shows his acting experience), Decent from Maria Bakalova (Plays Ivana decently well, but does not have the best chemistry with Stan), Decent from Martin Donovan (Plays the typical wealthy father role), Bad from the rest of the cast (A bunch of inexperienced background actors who have poor line delivery)), Decent Score (It feels like we had Succession at home), Pretty Good Cinematography (Helps capture this tube-TV, 1980s feel well), Pretty Bad Editing (While it does give this movie a 1980s feel, it is not well-put together), Good Production Design (Helps capture 1980s New York City), Good Makeup (Really helps transform Stan into Trump), Pacing is not great as the movie feels like it's split into two parts, with different pacing, Climax is very anticlimactic as the plot structure does not build to the ending well, Tone is a massive problem, as the movie never knows what it wants to be. Overall, a poorly made movie because the directing and writing present no nuance, since the movie does not know what story it wants to tell; it tries to be a movie about Donald Trump and Roy Cohn's relationship, but ends up just being a movie about the former; though, Sebastian Stan's performance as young Donald Trump is really spot on, that it's uncanny.",2024.0,10/15/2024,493.0,tt8368368
Ghostbusters,8.1,"Good Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good, as it establishes the 80s comedy-horror vibe that makes Ghostbusters a classic; the direction on a microscale is good, as the interpersonal scenes are where the comedy really comes out, and there is a sense that there is great chemistry within the cast; the storytelling is very linear and 80s; they build tension in a very 80s campy way), Very Good Story (The concept is interesting and iconic; the plot structure is pretty linear and very 1980s; character writing is very good as all Ghostbusters are such iconic characters), Good to Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue is iconic and filled with memorable lines; the humor is good and really makes this movie a true comedy; the foreshadowing is decently prevalent), Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Bill Murray (He has amazing charisma and really steals the show in his scenes with his comedic timing), Good from Dan Aykroyd (Has good comedic timing and great chemistry with Murray and the rest of the cast), Good from Sigourney Weaver (Plays the female interest well and has good chemistry with Murray), Pretty Good to Good from Harold Ramis (Plays the comedic straight man well and has good chemistry with the main Ghostbusters), Good from Rick Moranis (Plays the nerdy slapstick character well), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (The cast as a whole has good comedic timing and good chemistry, both from the main cast and the supporting cast)), Good Score (Gives the movie its iconic 1980s feel), Great Soundtrack (One of the most iconic theme songs for any movie), Good Cinematography, Good Editing (A bit dated but good for its time), Good Sound, Pretty Good Visual Effects (Very dated in comparison to today's technology, but still good for the time period; the CGI for the ghosts was fine, but looked pretty bad for the 'dogs'; the use of practical effects still holds very well), Great Costumes (Iconic Ghostbusters costumes), Pacing is pretty standard, The climax is executed well, Tone is very 1980s horror-comedy.

We Live in Time,6.4,"Decent Direction (The direction on a macroscale is decent, it feels like a little more polished rom-com; the direction on a microscale is good as this is where you really see the rom-com elements and the chemistry between Garfield and Pugh; the storytelling is interesting for the most part as it tells three stories from the couple's lives in parallel, but this storytelling style gets disregarded in the final 40 minutes and the movie goes back to being a generic rom-com), Decent Story (The concept is interesting for the most part because it looks at three arcs of a couple's relationship, but they disregard this concept in the last 40 minutes as they basically just focus on the present story; the plot structure follows three separate story arcs in a couple's relationship for the first hour, but then follows the present day storyline for the final 40 minutes; character writing is alright as the female lead has some depth to her, but overall these characters are not that memorable), Decent Screenplay (The dialogue is pretty good and polished, but not that memorable; the humor is typical of other rom-coms; the symbolism is present as it revolves around this relationship and the importance of living in the moment; the foreshadowing is present in that events from the past story arcs lead into the present), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good from Andrew Garfield (Well-experienced performance and has good chemistry with Pugh), Good from Florence Pugh (Well-experienced performer and has good chemistry with Garfield), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast (The movie is really about the two leads, but the supporting cast does a pretty good job in supporting them)), Pretty Good Score (Helps establish the tone and is used well;  Pretty good composition overall), Pretty Good Cinematography (It has a lot of interesting and cool shots), Pretty Good Editing (Seems polished and helps show how the three stories are connected), Pacing is fine for the most part as you are going through these three different timelines, but feels a bit slow in the end as they solely focus on the present-day story, The climax is not really that interesting as they threw away what made the movie interesting just to focus on the present day; the ending to the present day storyline was decent at best, Tone is very similar to other rom-coms, There really isn't anything in this movie that makes it memorable.

The Piano Lesson,6.8,"Pretty Bad Direction (The direction on a macroscale feels very amateur and not that well executed; the direction on a microscale is fine as it mimics other August Wilson movies in that it allows the actors to act with minimal intervention, similar to a play; the storytelling is a bit muddy as they did not know what tone they wanted to go with throughout the movie; tension is not built that well because they try to force this horror, ghost story that is not that well executed), Decent Story (The concept deviates from the original play and makes the movie an unnecessary supernatural ghost story, which kind of hurts the story dealing with the generational trauma from their ancestors; the plot structure is nothing special; the character writing is not that great because they keep introducing many characters and do not do a good job providing them backstory to make you root for them, except for maybe Deadwyler's character), Good Screenplay (The dialogue is very authentic to the source material and other August Wilson works; the humor is pretty true to other August Wilson works; the symbolism is profound as the whole movie deals with generational trauma this family has dealt with from slavery and racism; the foreshadowing is present but kinda expected), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good from Samuel L. Jackson (Feels like he pulls a lot from his experience as an actor in this role, but he does not feel like he is used as much as he should have been), Pretty Good to Good from John David Washington (Plays the lead role decently well, as this character feels like it plays to his strengths as an actor), Pretty Bad from Ray Fisher (Really feels off in comparison to the rest of the cat as his comedic humor feels very forced), Pretty Good to Good from Michael Potts, Pretty Good from Erykah Badu, Pretty Good from Skylar Aleece Smith, Very Good from Danielle Deadwyler (Steals the show in all her scenes as she shows a wide range of emotions and accurately displays a mother trying to hold onto her family and ancestry), Good from Corey Hawkins (Plays his role well and has good chemistry with Deadwyler), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast (The cast as a whole works well together; it was evident that the director let the actors act in a way similar to the play)), Decent Score (Used decently well throughout the movie; for a movie called 'The Piano Lesson' it would have been great to have at least heard one piano motif throughout the movie, so not having this feels like a wasted opportunity), Pretty Bad Cinematography (Felt pretty amateur and not that well executed, especailly in the climax), Pretty Bad Editing (Felt pretty amateur), Pretty Good Sound (Helps enhance those horror elements), Pretty Bad Visual Effects (Felt pretty tacky), Good Production Design (Felt authentic to the time period), Good Costumes (Felt authentic to the time period), Pacing is pretty slow as it tries to mimic the play's pacing, Climax is chaotic and poorly executed; the ending felt very anticlimactic, Tone is a big issue for this movie because there never felt like there was a consistent tone as they tried to make this movie both a historical drama and a ghost story; they tried to do a lot of things and couldn't do any of them well, Saw premiere at the Austin Film Festival.

Overall, a pretty good musical that has memorable performances from the leads and well-executed musical numbers; but ""Wicked"" is incredibly slow and bloated in its exposition, as they stretched out the first act of a two-hour and forty-minute musical into a two-hour and forty-minute part one movie.",2024.0,11/17/2024,511.0,tt1262426
